004d4982-0921-4940-aed7-cf64bea3bd22,"1. the removal of each additional electron requires more energy is because less electrons on the same shell will lead to a less electron repulsion, which means lower potential energy and higher ionization energy. This explains why the removal of third and fourth electrons requires smiliar energy but removing the 4th requires more. Both 3rd and 4th are on 3s orbital, hence they have the same core charge and radius to the nuclues, so the only factor impacting the energy difference is the reducing electron repulsion.

2. removal of the fifths electron takes a lot lot more energy than 4th, because fifth electron located on 2p shell, which originally had a complete electron configuration. Assuming the core charge does not change compare to the 3rd and 4th electron, the radius of 2p shell is a lot smaller, leading to a much higher ionization energy, because the electrons feel a much stronger attraction from the nucleus.Â ",
015f26aa-4e5c-41ae-b89d-0c05c9b167e4,"With each removal of an electron, there is less electron-electron repulsion, which decreases the potential energy of the electrons as they are more strongly attracted to the nucleus, and ultimately increasing each successive ionization energy.Â 

The ionization energies of the third and fourth electron are similar due to the fact that both of these electrons reside in the sameÂ n quantum number (3), meaning they are basically the same radius away from the nucleus. Furthermore, these two electrons have the same core charge of +4. This indicates the potential energies and thus the resulting ionization energies are similar, as Coulomb's Law states potential energy is given by V(r) =(+Ze)(-e)/r. The difference in these two energies is due to the fact that the electrons in the 3p orbital experience greater electron-electron repulsion than those in the 3s, and 3s electrons have greater probability of core penetration. This is supported by silicon's electron configuration of 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^2.Â 

However, there is a large jump in ionization energy from removal of the fourth to fifth electron because there is a significant decrease in the distance between the electron and nucleus (r), as the fifth electron is removed from the n=2 shell instead of the third. Thus, the core charge felt by the fifth electron is +12, significantly increasing the ionization energy.",
03267d44-9361-4a78-a58c-1c2fd0dc4384,"1) The removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the removal of the previous one because according to Coulomb's Law, Ionization energy is proportional to the relative charges and distance. As distance decreases, Ionization increases. When you remove an electron, you decrease the repulsion between the electrons and you reduce the shielding if you take away too much electrons (which was evident in the third ionization energy). Since the shielding is decreased and thereby the repulsion, the Ionization energy gets higher.

2)The relative magnitudes observed show that the fifth ionization energy is way larger in magnitude than compared to that of the third and fourth. As a result of that, you can see that the electrons are in an inner orbital starting from the fifth due to the fact that there is the same positive charge acting on the electrons, but this time the electrons have less shielding.Â  The huge relative jump always shows a change in the orbital.",
03bfd974-3d84-47c8-8f76-9da5be0b0a58,"Coulomb's Law gives us the potential energy that an e- feels within an atom which is due to the attraction to the nucleus. This is a negative PE value which will be low, however, due to e-/e- repulsions (which is a positive PE value) it will increase the PEtotal of the e-. So as you remove e- the PE will lower because there will be less e-/e- repulsion. This helps explain the trend within a shell which would have a comparable magnitude in IE (aka third and fourth IE here). In addition to this, as you get closer to the nucleus (aka r becomes smaller) an e- will feel a greater attraction due to the proximity and the new effective core charge felt by the e- since there will be less shielding e- that reduce the effective core charge it feels. This gives the reason as to why there are big jumps in IE, (like between the fourth and fifth ones here). The huge jump means that the distance r must have gotten incredibly smaller and if r got smaller then the effective core charge also increased, which causes for PE to lower a lot more. This makes the IE to increase since it takes more energy to ionize said e- (bringing the e- infinitely far away as to no longer feel the attraction to the nuclues). Overall, Coulomb's law tells us that if an e- is closer to the nucleus it will feel a greater attraction, this will also occur if the effective core charge is much bigger as well (in magnitude). Then if you remove more e- you will lower the PE because there are less e-/e- repulsions which would make PE higher.Â ",
03fa8f3d-b4d6-48c7-b383-b10fbb5df2d0,"1) Each successive electron requires a higher ionization energy because of a reduction in electron-electron repulsion. As electrons are removed, there are less electrons in the atom resulting in less electron-electron repulsion. With less electron-electron repulsion, ionization energy would increase in order to make up for the lost repulsion forces.Â 

2) The 3rd and 4th electrons to be ionized are ionized from the same shell. Their core charges are nuclear charge-inner shell e- = 4+, therefore being similar in magnitude. However, the 5th electron to be ionized would have a large core charge increase as the 1st shell becomes the new ""inner shell."" It gives a core charge of 14-2= +12. This accounts for the large increase in IE for the 5th electron.Â ",
04063add-b4ce-4af4-8af2-5a8f44745b79,"Removing an electron from the atom increases the value of the core charge. Here, Si has 4 valence electrons, so it has a core charge of (atomic # - valence electrons) = 14-4=10. However, when a valence electron is removed, the core charge becomes 14-3=11, and so on for each time an electron is removed. Coulombs law gives the potential energy of this system, and is proportional to (q1)(q2)/R. In this case, the electron's charge is a negative constant, while the core charge is increasing, thus meaning the magnitude of the potential energy is increasing, meaning that the the ionization energy is also increasing.

The third and fourth ionization energies are similar, but the fifth ionization energy has a much larger value. This is because Si has 4 valence electrons, so removing a 5th electron represents removing an electron from the core instead of the valence resulting in a much higher ionization energy.",

The third and fourth correspond to the removal of two 3s electrons. Core charge for both ionisations = (14-10)= 4, but the radius of the fourth is slightly smaller because protons are attracting fewer electrons. The fifth corresponds to the removal of the 2p electron. Since 2p orbital is closer to the nucleus, the ionization energy will increase. Since r has significantly decreased and the core charge is (14-2)= 12 there should be an abrupt increase.",

The potential energy gets smaller (more negative) when the radius between the electron and the nucleus gets closer (decrease of r )and when the core charges increase. Lower potential energy means it has more energy to ionize the electron (IE). Therefore, when the electrons are removed from the valence shell, the more energy (Ionization energy) is in need to release the electrons close to the nucleus.Â ",
0708eaac-c84c-4936-885e-4a64e24679bc,"1) The removal of each electron decreases the force of electron-electron repulsion felt by each electron, effectively increasing the attraction of each valence electron to the core of the atom. This results in a (smaller) increase in ionization energy .

2) While my explanation from part 1 explains the increase in ionization energies up till the removal of the fifth electron, it doesn't explain the dramatic increase in ionization energy required to remove the fifth electron. This increase is due to all of the outer 4 valence shell electrons being already removed, causing the fifth electron to be removed from a more stable shell that is significantly closer to the core of the atom. Since the fifth atom is being removed from a closer shell, the effective core charge of the atom also dramatically increases as there are fewer shielding electron shells between the electron and the core. Coulomb's law tells us that the potential energy of this electron will therefore be much lower than those of the previously removed electrons, so the energy required to remove this electron will be significantly higher.",
07f978ef-83d7-4ee8-872e-7b4efd268709,"Successive ionization energies increase with each removed electron because of electron-electron repulsion. As each electron is removed from the valence shell, then the remaining electrons feel less repulsion from each other and thus it becomes harder to ionize them. Electron-electron repulsion causes an increase in potential energy, which then reduces the amount of ionization energy needed to remove an electron. Therefore, if that repulsion is gone, then PE decreases and IE needed to pull of an electron increases.Â 

The relative magnitudes of the values are caused by the successive ionization energies, as in part one, and the addition of ionizing from a new shell. The fifth ionization energy ""jumps"" because the four valence electrons have been removed and now the next electron is in a shell closer to the nucleus (r is smaller) and the effective core charge felt by the electrons on the new shell is also greater (z eff). Using Coloumb's law, we know that q1q2/r = PE, so if r is smaller and q2 is bigger, both are going to lead to a higher PE which will in turn contribute to a much larger ionization energy.",

1) The removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the removal of the previous one because of electron repulsion. Electrons are negatively charged so they have higher potential energy when they are near each other in the same shell. The removal of one electron from the outermost shell decreases the potential energy of the other electrons so more energy is required to raise their potential energy to 0.

2) The magnitude of the ionization energy of the fifth electron is disproportionately larger than the magnitudes of the third and fourth because the fifth electron is removed from a lower shell than the third and fourth electrons. Because there is a relatively large distance between each electron shell, the value of r reduces significantly while the effective core charge increases from+4 to +12. These two changes both work to the fifth electronÂ  to have a much lower potential energy relative to the third and fourth electrons so more Ionization energy is required to reduce its potential energy to 0.",
0993dee5-ed6d-43d9-92d5-bf5fc9ba26ad,"As electrons are removed, ionization energies increases. This is because of an increase in core charge (there are more attractive interactions between the nucleus and electrons), decrease in radius (radius decreases through the transitions from outer shells to inner shells, so there is more attraction from the nucleus to the electrons), and decrease in electron-electron repulsions (there are less electrons to be accounted for, thus less repulsive interactions between electrons). Analyzing these findings through Coulomb's Law, the denominator (radius) decreases, while core charge increases, thus the ionization energy required to remove an electron increases.Â  The ionization energies given demonstrate that there are two electrons in the same shell, while there is one that is in an inner shell. The values 3231 kJ/mol and 4356 kJ/mol signal that these electrons are in the same shell, yet they are not exactly equal because of the electron-electron repulsions present in that shell, which slightly lowers ionization energy. Then there is a very large ""jump"" from the ionization energies of 4356 kJ/mol and 16091 kJ/mol, demonstrating a change in electron shells; this can be concluded because there is much more energy required to remove an electron in an inner shell because of the increase in core charge, decrease in radius, and decrease in electron-electron repulsions explained above.Â ",
099e3df9-ff50-43c4-843f-f0777fcb4ea0,"1. The removal of additional electrons requires more energy then before because you are getting close and closer to the nucleus. This decreases the radius in Coulombs equation q1*q2/r^2 which would make the attraction to the nucleus much higher, which would increase the energy needed to ionize that electron. In addition, as you get into closer and closer orbitals, the Zeff increases de to less shielding electrons further increasing the attraction to the nucleus and thus the energy needed to ionize that electron.

0a36e6b5-1c71-483a-936c-44dc76292618,"1) The removal of each electron requires more energy because removing electrons successively reduces the electron-electron repulsion felt by electrons within the atom. This decreases potential energy based on the Coulombic equation because the core effective charge is reduced by the removal of positive potential energies between the electrons. Since the potential energy is reduced, more energy is required to remove the electrons as more electrons are removed from the atom.Â 

2) There is a large increase in magnitude of ionization energies between the removal of the fourth and fifth electrons because the fifth electron is removed from a lower energy shell than the fourth electron. The fifth electron has a lower energy level as a result of having a smaller radius and experiencing a larger core effective charge because there are fewer inner electrons shielding the positively charged nucleus. The large core effective charge and small radius contribute to a much lower potential energy according to Coulomb's Law for the fifth electron than the fourth, which exists at a higher energy level. Additionally, there is still less electron-electron repulsion as a result of one of the electrons being removed.Â ",

The fourth ionization energy corresponds to the removal of another electron after removing the first valence electron. The core charge for such an electron would be 14-10 = +4. In addition, since the electron is being removed from the same shell, the atomic radius would not differ much. However, since there is one less electron present, the electron- electron repulsion felt by this second valence electron is less. As a result, there is an increase in ionization energy. (slight increase)

The fifth ionization energy is much larger because there is a significant change in atomic radius and in core charge. Core charge is now 14-2 = +12. This is because we moved down a shell from the valence shell to the second shell. As a result of this drastic change in atomic radius and core charge, based on coulombs law we know that there is a significant increase in ionization energy as represented by the data.

Therefore, removing the third and fourth requires increasingly more energy. Going from the fourth to the fifth, silicon uses all the valence electrons on n = 3 and goes down an energy level to n = 2. Therefore, the radius drastically decreases which inversely increases the ionization energy of the electron because it is closer to the nucleus which has a strong hold on it.Â ",

There is a large jump from the 4th ionization energy to the 5th ionization energy. Since the core charge remains the same, it means that there must have been a large decrease in the radius.

Electron-electron repulsion increases the potential energy of an electron (makes the potential energy less negative), thus making the ionization energy smaller. So when this influence is removed, the ionization energy increases. Ionization energies also see a great increase in magnitude when an atom's outer shell is depleted, because electrons are now being removed from a shell that is closer to the nucleus, and since the electrons in these shells are closer to the nucleus, they are more strongly attracted to it, and thus take a greater amount of energy to remove from the atom. Another factor that influences this increase in magnitude is the increase of the effective core charge - when an atom's valence shell is depleted, the shell just below it becomes the valence shell, and the electrons inside it are no longer shielding electrons. Thus, the effective core charge becomes greater, and the electrons that remain in the atom are more strongly attracted to the nucleus,Â  and thus require more energy to ionize. This is why we see a great increase in magnitude of ionization energy between the fourth and fifth ionization energies of silicon compared to the others - silicon has 4 valence electrons, so the 5th ionization energy is the point in which electrons begin being removed from the shell just below what was silicon's original valence shell, because the original valence shell has been depleted of electrons.",

2) In its neutral form, Si has 14 electrons around its nucleus. The corresponding electron configuration - 1s22s22p63s23p2 - tells us that it has 4 electrons in its outermost shell. Counting up the superscripts (which indicate the number of electrons) says that there are 4 electrons in that valence shell. So, after the 4th electron has been removed, Si only has 10 electrons surrounding it, and the valence shell is now n=2 instead of n=3. This means that the electrons are much closer to the nucleus, and because of the fact that they are in a lower shell, feel a much higher core charge (14 - 10 = 4 compared to 14 - 2 = 12). The increased core charge combined with the decreased radius, by Coulomb's Law, will increase the amount of energy needed to ionize these electrons.

This can be attributed to electron-electron repulsion. The smaller radius will increase the energy needed to remove the electron, thanks to Coulomb's law. There is also a large difference in the 5th ionization energy compared to those previous.

After the first four electrons from Si are removed Si has a full valence shell and attempting to remove a electron from a full valence shell is so difficult because the atom is stable and simply doesn't want to lose any more electrons so it becomes that much more difficult to remove that fifth electron. The reason that it becomes more difficult to remove electrons is because of potentially two reasons: first there are less electrons in the valence shell so there is less repulsion force as a result more attractive force towards the nucleus and when you take enough electrons away that you drop a shell those electrons are closer to the proton so feel a stronger attraction to a proton.,

The original core charge of silicon before any electrons were removed was +4.

This must mean that there are 4 valence electrons in the valence shell because of the big jump between the fourth and fifth ionization energies. When the fifth Â electrons is removed, the core charge is now + 7 and the ionization energy has increase because the electron being removed is in a lower shell.

The third and forth ionization energies are of similar magnitude because the electrons are being removed from the same electron shell. The fifth electron is being taken from a shell closer to the nucleus since there are no more electrons in the valence shell. This large decrease of radius results in a large increase in ionization energy.",
1bc6ffba-edc2-4789-94d1-8a6645921781,"1. The removal of each additional electron decreases the electron-electron repulsion in that shell. Because of this, the remaining electrons are held closer to the nucleus, thus decreasing the radius, and therefore increasing the pull the electrons feel from the nucleus. When we remove the fifth electron, we see a jump in ionization energy because we have previously taken all the electrons from the valence shell, and have now started removing electrons from an inner shell. This is held much closer to the nucleus so we see an even larger increase in ionization energy, as according to Coulomb's Law, radius is inversely proportional to ionization energy. So a large decrease in radius= a large increase in ionization energy

2. We know that when removing electrons from silicon the number of protons (the nuclear charge) isn't changing, and we know that the charge of an electron isn't changing, so the main difference we observe in the magnitude of ionization energy is due to the radius changing.Â  Knowing the third and fourth electron removed are from the valence shell we can expect to see similar values. (with the fourth electron having a larger ionization energy). But we know the fifth electron is removed from an inner shell, with a much smaller radius so we would expect to see a much larger ionization energy due to the inverse relationship described in coulomb's law.",
1e9339db-ed12-4ee7-9911-8f2e3f61c0f6,"1) The removal of each additional electron requires more energy that the removal of the previous one because of electron repulsion. With more electron repulsion, IE is reduced because not as much energy is needed to remove an electron if the other electrons in the atoms are already repelling it. However, if there are fewer electrons then before, the electron you're removing needs more IE to remove since it's being repulsed by fewer electrons.Â 

Â 

2) The relative magnitudes make sense. The first two IEs are in the same electron shell, and are therefore fairly similar. The jump from 4356 to 16091 from the 4th to 5th IE is a result of removing an electron from a new full valence shell that is closer to the nucleus. Coloumb's law states that a lowered distance between the nucleus and the electrons means a strong electronic force between them, meaning more attraction. Therefore, since the 5th IE is in a shell closer to the positivrly charged nucleus, it experiences more attraction to it, therefore requiring a substantially higher IE than a 3rd or 4th IE.",

The removal of each additional electron requires more energy than that of the previous one primarily as a result of the reduction of electron-electron repulsion within an electron shell as a result of fewer and fewer electrons being present. This is represented by the increase in ionization energy from 3231 kJ/mol to 4356 kJ/mol for the first two electrons removed. However, the large jump of ionization energy in the silicon atom from 4356 kJ/mol to 16091 kJ/mol comes as a result of the fifth electron being removed from the silicon's next inner electron shell, as the core charge for this inner shell is far larger than that of the outer shell. That, alongside a decrease in the distance from the electron to the nucleus, according to Coulomb's Law, signifies much larger ionization energy.",
1faf0e89-9dcc-4243-b549-efa4a9524470,"Each time an electron is removed, there is less electron-electron repulsion and so the nucleus is able to attract the electrons a bit closer. Thus, using Coulomb's law, the potential energy becomes more negative with less electron-electron repulsion and, as a result, more energy will be required to remove another electron.

The fifth ionization energy is far greater than the third and fourth ionization energies because we have now gone down to another shell in the fifth ionization energy. By moving down to another shell, the radius of the atom greatly decreases and so we can observe a large difference between the fifth ionization energy and the third and fourth ionization energies. The third and fourth ionization energies are on the same shell and so do not have as much of a difference between them.",
20066229-45da-4c82-85fd-22e61c8a223b,"1) Because there are less electron electron repulsions as you remove more electrons, this means that the PE of the next electron decreases resulting in an increase of the ionization energy.

2) The big jump between the fourth and the fifth ionization energies is due to the differences in core charge and radius. For the third and fourth IEs, the core charge is +5 while the core charge for the fifth IE is +11. Furthermore, the fifth IE is a removal of an electron in a lower shell than the third and fourth IE so the radius involved is smaller for the fifth IE. According toÂ  Coulomb's Law which is (q1*q2)/r , this shows that because the fifth electron to be removed has a higher core charge and a smaller radius, the magnitude of the IE will be greater compared to the 3rd and 4th IE which have the same core charge and are the same distance away from the nucleus.",

Since they are in the same subshell the core charge is the same between them but the valence electron - valence electron repulsions decrease as the 3rd electron is removed making the attraction to the nucleus slightly greater. There is a drastic jump in ionization energy as the fifth electron is removed because this electron is being removed from a subshell that is closer to the nucleus, 2p. As Coulomb's law suggests this increases the magnitude of the potential energy as the radius is now smaller and there are less electron-electron repulsions.Â ",
20b524df-8abc-42f9-8445-712c79f85aac,"The removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the previous because first, electron-electron repulsions (because of electrostatic attractions and repelling) always increase the potential energy of an electron in an atom, and therefore decrease its ionization energy (the energy transition needed for the electron to reach potential energy of zero from the energy level it exists in the atom); therefore for each successive electron removed, the electron-electron repulsions within that shell are lowered, and ionization energy increases. This explains the unusually large jump between the fourth and fifth electrons' ionization energies;Â  Coulomb's law conveys that that PE= k((q1q2)/r), where the potential energy of an electron in an atom is inversely related to the radius or distance between the electron being removed and the positively charged nucleus (q1 indicates the effective core charge, q2 indicates the -1 charge of an electron, and r is the distance between the two). The third and fourth electron would be removed from the 3s subshell, however, the 5th electron would be removed from the 2p subshell of silicon (Electron configuration: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^2). The distance between the nucleus and the 2p subshell is much less than the distance between the nucleus and the 3s subshell, indicating a much lower potential energy for an electron residing in the 2p orbital. The effective core charge felt by an electron in the 3s subshell would be +4 (atomic number 14 - inner shell electrons 10 = +4), while the effective core charge felt by an electron in the 2p orbital would be +10, which is much higher, and thus each electron in this shell feels a much higher attraction to the nucleus, causing its energy to be much lower (seen by Coulomb's law) and therefore its ionization energy to be higher (more energy required to make its energy 0).Â ",

The ionization energy of the fourth electron (4346 kJ/mol) is slightly larger than the ionization energy of the third electron (3231 kJ/mol) because of the decrease in electron-electron repulsion. Using Coulombs Law, q1 (core charge) remains constant, q2 (charge of the electron) remains constant, and r (radius or distance between q1 and q2) decreases by a very small amount as there is only one electron in the 3p shell instead of the original two. The slight decrease in radius can be explained by the loss of electron-electron repulsion within the 3p sub-shell.Â 

The ionization energy of the fifth electron (16091 kJ/mol) is much greater in magnitude than the ionization energy of the third electron (3231 kJ/mol) because of the significant decrease in radius. Using Coulomb's Law, q1 (core charge) remains constant, q2 (charge of the electron) remains constant, and r (radius or distance between q1 and q2) decreases by a large amount as the 3p sub-shell is removed of all electrons, making the atomic radius only extend to the 3s sub-shell. This significant decrease in radius explains the large increase in ionization energy as r is in the denominator, yielding a higher quotient (as the numerator remained constant).Â 

The ionization energies of the third and fourth electrons are similar in magnitude because the electrons are in the same sub-shell (the 3p sub-shell). But, the third electron's IE is slightly smaller than the fourth electron's IE due to electron-electron repulsion (and thus a slightly larger radius).

The ionization energy of the fifth electron is much larger than that of the fourth and third because the fifth electron is in a different (more inward) sub-shell. This decreases the radius of the atom by a significant amount.

Thus, the electrons before the huge jump in IE (the fourth and third electrons) are in the valence sub-shell of silicon (3p) while the electron after the huge jump in IE (the fifth electron) is in an interior sub-shell of silicon (3s).",

2) IE3 and IE4 are relatively similar, yet IE4 has a larger magnitude because of the reduced electron-electron repulsion with relatively similar radius and no change in effective core charge. The large jump between IE4 and IE5 is due to the radius dramatically decreasing because we have removed all electrons from one shell. This large jump in IE shows that the 5th electron removed is in the next inner shell. Furthermore, this large jump can also be attributed to a much larger effective core charge (from +4 to +12) and less electron-electron repulsion.

This happens because silicon has two valence electrons, located in the 3s subshell. Once these electrons are removed, the next electrons are located in an inner shell. This means that while the core charge has still increased slightly, the radius has also decreased. Since Coulomb's law tells us that IE and radius have an inverse relationship, when the radius decreases, IE increases significantly. This explains why there is a large jump in IE after the second electron is removed.",

This due to two factors, first the fifth electron is in the next lowest electron shell, and therefore significantly closer to the radius. This decrease in radius increases IE. Additionally, the shift to the next lowest subshell removes a shells worth of shielding electrons that were reducing the effective core charge on each electron.

2. The relative magnitude of the observed ionization energy values are seen due to a new, lower principal energy level for the 5th ionization energy.

Removing the 5th electron requires a much larger ionization energy of (16091 kJ/mol) because it is coimg from the inner shell of n=2, and so feels an increased effective core charge of +12 (14 - 2 shielding electrons), hence is more strongly attracted to the nucleus; furthermore, there is a significant decrease in the distnace between the electron and the nuclues (reduced radius) and according to Couloumb's law these two factors combined sould result in a much higher ionization energy of 16091 kJ/mol.Â ",

The removal of each electron from an atom would require more energy than the removal of its previous electron because the energy required increases as radius decreases (radius squared is the denominator in Coulomb's Law, so smaller denominator means larger value). Taking into consideration electron-electron repulsion, ionization energy would also increase within the same shell because less electrons in the shell means less electron-electron repulsion. The last electron in a shell would therefore have the highest ionization energy.

Â 

2) Because the third and fourth electrons are on the same shell, they require similar ionization energies with the fourth still being larger due to the lack of electron-electron repulsion after the third electron is taken away. The fifth has a significantly larger ionization energy because it is on the next shell closer to the nucleus, therefore decreasing its radius and increasing its attraction to the nucleus.Â ",
24e63ed9-6eb5-4fd8-b526-eb49db10db88,"Coulomb's law evidences that ionization energy can be calculated dependent on both core charge (in the numerator of the expression) and atomic radius (in the denominator of the expression).

The core charge between the third and fourth electrons to be ionized doesn't change as the amount of core electrons stays consistent, and the atomic radius is also very similar, but we can attribute the increase (but not of a large magnitude) in successive ionization energy due to the fact that electron-electron repulsion is being reduced as each successive electron is ionized. The difference between the third and fourth electrons ionized is not that great in terms of relative magnitude due to the fact that neither the core charge or the atomic radius is altered, and the largest contributing factor to this change is a reduction in electron-electron repulsion. That being said we see an increase in ionization energy of a significant magnitude between the fourth and fifth electrons and that is for multiple reasons. The fourth electron is the last valence electron in a shell, therefore the next electron to be ionized is being done so from the next shell inwards, i.e. there is a significant decrease in atomic radius from the nucleus, and therefore ionization energy will increase as a result of this. In addition to a decrease in atomic radius, this new shell with 8 electrons is no longer considered to hold core electrons and thus core charge (calculated by subtracting the number of core electrons from the number of protons) is much higher, resulting in an increase in ionization energy from this factor as well, thus evidencing both why successive ionization energy increases AND why the magnitude of difference between the fourth and fifth electrons is so great.Â ",
256237e0-fbe6-4abe-8c2e-ee72c7cbaf87,"The ionization energies described in the question are successive ionization energies. Coulomb's Law is shown below:Â

Coulomb's Law calculates the Potential Energy (Ionization Energy = negative of Potential Energy --> IE = -PE). Core charge is proportional to the ionization energy.Â Overall, this means that core charge and radius have the biggest impact on ionization energy.Â 

1.) The removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the previous one because of the core charges and e-e repulsion. The formula for core charge (or how much charge is felt by the electron) is as follows:Â 

[LaTeX: Core\:Charge\:=protons\:-\:shielding\:electrons] (/equation_images/Core%255C%253ACharge%255C%253A%253Dprotons%255C%253A-%255C%253Ashielding%255C%253Aelectrons)

Because of this, when electrons are successively removed, the core charge increases and therefore increases the IE. Additionally, e-e repulsion (or the forces from other electrons) also contribute to a lower IE, so when more electrons are being removed, the e-e repulsion lowers and the IE gets higher.Â 

Thus, IE1 < IE2 <IE3 <IE4Â Â and so on.Â 

2) We are given 3231, 4356, and 16091 kJ/mol for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th ionizations. The electron configurations for these ionizations are:Â 

3rd: 1s22s22p63s2 --> 1s22s22p63s1

4th: 1s22s22p63s1Â --> 1s22s22p6

5th: 1s22s22p6 --> 1s22s22p5

As shown, the j4th IE is fairly small because 3s1 was not a full shell. However, the 5th ionization energy is large because a full shell is losing an electron. This is because when there are fewer shells, the core charge felt by the electrons is high and the radius is smaller, and per Coulomb's law, the IE is larger.Â

In addition, as electrons leave, the distance between the electrons and the nucleus decrease as the electrons are found on closer subshells, and based on Coulomb's Law, the closer distance to the nucleus increases the attraction felt by electrons, which also requires more energy.Â 

The third ionization energy (IE) is distinct from the fourth IE, but they are still similar in magnitude compared with the fifth IE, which is significantly larger than the first two IEs. This is because of the existence of shells. The third and fourth electrons are in the 3s shell, but they are slightly different from each other because of the difference in electron electron repulsion. However, the fifth IE is much larger because the fifth electron is in the 2p shell, which is much closer to the nucleus of the atom, so the attraction that the electron feels at 2p requires much more energy to overcome compared to the other two electrons. Coulomb' s law demonstrates this with the decreasing radius corresponding to the increasing energy.Â ",
263af335-57b9-414f-9f8c-374a2c3dad16,"1) Electrons in an atom have negative potential energies according to Coulomb's Law: PE = k(q1 x q2)/r, because the core charge (positive) and the electron (negative) have opposite charges. The removal of an electron thus requires input of energy (ionization energy). Ionization energy is higher when the core charge is the same but the electron-electron repulsion decreases, because it lowers the potential energy. As we remove electrons successively, the number of electrons left decreases and so does electron-electron repulsion, and the core charge felt by these electrons stays the same, 14-2-8 = +4 (or increases, as we move to an inner shell, 14-2 = +12), so the ionization energy increases.

2) 3231 and 4356 kJ/mol are close, and the fourth electron removed has a higher ionization energy because of decreasing electron electron repulsion. The reason why these 2 values are close to each other is that the 2 electrons (3rd and 4th) are both in the 3s subshell, so the core charge they feel (14-2-8=+4) as well as the radius from the nucleus for both electrons (n=3 radius) are the same. 16091 kJ/mol, IE for the fifth electron, is much larger than the other 2 because this electron is in the 2p subshell, with a smaller radius at n=2 compared to n=3, and a larger core charge felt (14-2=+12).

26421893-1cc8-4128-982e-a226ab7a8b62,"1) The removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the removal of the previous because Cuolomb's law dictates that the magnitude of the charges is divided by the radius and provided that r stays constant as we remove 5 electron from a stable Si atom, Z would increase asÂ  more electrons are taken from the atom there for dividing a larger number ( dictated by q1 * q2) by a constant r yielding a lower PE and thus higher IE as electrons are removed.

Si core calculation: Zeff = 14-10 = 4 in neutral atom (number of electrons shielding would go down especially as electrons are taken from n=2 for fifth e/reducing electron repulsion overtime which also increases IE per electorn removed)

2) Relative magnitude of the values increased drastically from the fourth to fifth IE energies because it takes more energy to remove an electron going from n=3 to n=2 shell causing IE to sharply increase (as more energy is needed to overcome the higher IE to remove an electron from the atom). This is made even more clear by the near quadrupling of the IE from fourth to fifth IE.",
26575853-040f-4531-9bac-6a23a1c9ac98,Coulomb's Law defines the relationship between the potential energy of an atom's nucleus and one of its valence electrons. He defined the relationship as a ratio of the charges divided by the distance between them. Each subsequent removal requires more energy as there is decreasing size in the radius which increases the force of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons. The magnitudes observed recognize this and increase steadily until the fifth ionization energy when there is a large increase. This comes from a drop in electron shells. When the four valence electrons in silicon are removed the next ionization energy must remove an electron from an interior shell which has a decreased radius separating the two charges and less electrons between the two shielding the attraction. These factors indicate a significant increase in ionization energy for Silicon between the 4th and 5th ionization energies.,

2) The magnitude of ionization energies increases dramatically between the fourth and fifth electrons removed. This suggests that the electrons are being removed from a different shell that is closer to the nucleus. When the core charges for Si are calculated between these electrons, the core charge of the Si5- is larger than the core charge of Si4-. By Coulomb's Law, (PE = q1q2/r) a larger core charge will make the magnitude of potential energy greater, which makes the ionization energy larger.Â ",

The difference between the first two given ionization energies compared to the third is the relative distance between the most outward electrons and the nucleus for the electrons being removed.

The magnitude of the increase can be explained by electron shell model which places electrons in core shells and valence shells. Ionizing the first 4 electrons of Si comes from the 3s and 3p subshells but these electrons are in the same shell. Therefore the energy difference is minimal due to similarity of distance from the nucleus and thereby core charge (difference is due to e-e repulsions).

The total of a +3 core charge increase, as well as the decrease in radius as the electrons go from shell 3 (n=3) to shell 2 (n=2) contributes to a higher ionization energy.Â ",

The removal of each additional electron requires more energy because the decrease in electron-electron repulsion within the subshell occurs as each is removed. Even though they are relatively the same distance this increase can be contributed to the change in effected core charge as the removal of more electrons in the same shell require more and in the firth ionization energy is in a different subshell requiring even more.

The ionization energy relative magnitudes observed of the third and fourth electrons are comparable in magnitude unlike the fifth ionization which is over three times as large as the fourth ionization energy.Â  This can be attributed to the third and fourth being apart of the same subshell within the atom of 2p.Â  Unlike the third and fourth ionization energies which are both in the 2p subshell, the ionization energy for the fifth electron is in the 2s subshell therefore it's proximity to the nucleus is shorter resulting in a smaller radius that increases the ionization energy drastically.Â Â ",
302c6682-98b6-4726-95cd-9813a4bcc19d,"The trend in these ionization energies are due to electron repulsion, core charge, radius between the electron and nucleus. We know that silicon has 14 electrons with 3 electron shells where the first has 2 electrons, the second has 8 electrons, and the 3rd has 4. As we remove electrons from the outer shell we see that the electron repulsion decreases due to electrons being removed from the outer shell. This causes a higher attraction between the next electron we will be attempting to ionize and the nucleus. This trend follows until the 5th ionized electron where we see a great increase in ionization energy. This increase was due to a noticeable decrease in radius between the electron we are ionizing and the nucleus. This causes for a stronger attraction and therefore a higher ionization energy to remove the electron despite that attraction.",
3162abd2-99ce-41b5-a7da-10a5f7aa0bfe,"Ionization energy shows the amount of energy needed to remove an electron from an atom, which means that the potential energy of the electron must become 0 from its original negative value. Hence, lower electron potential energy signifies higher ionization energy for the electron.

Coulomb's law shows how the magnitude of potential energy is proportional to the core charge actingÂ  on the electron of concern and inversely proportional to the distance between that electron and the nucleus of the atom of concern (PEÂ  proportional to q1q2/r). It also shows how electron-electron repulsion hence decreases the magnitude of this potential energy, as it increases its value.

When the three electron is removed, the first two have already been removed, so while the core charge (Si protons - inner shell electrons = 14 - 4 = +10) does not change and the radius is relatively similar (same period), there are less electrons in the atom at that point, and hence less electron-electron repulsion at that point, compared to the second ionization energy, making it require more energy to bring the PE to 0, hence greater ionization energy that the removal of the previous electron. This same idea applies to the fourth IE compared to the third, which is why the removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the removal of the previous one.

From the fourth to the fifth IE, there is a disproportionately large increase in magnitude compared to the third to fourth IE increase. This is because in q1q2/r, two main factors are changing. The core charge increases from +4 to +8, and the distance between the removed electron and the nucleus of the atom decreases significantly as the fifth IE refers to an electron from the 2nd shell while the fourth is from the third. According to coulombs law, this increases greatly the magnitude of PE, lowering its value, so it requires much more IE to remove the next electron, compared to the difference between the 3rd and 4th which just accounted mainly for changes in e-e repulsion as describes which has a much smaller effect on PE.",
32d4ca9f-788b-4509-b8f0-482015730eb7,"1) Coulomb's law shows that the potential energy of an electron is equal to q1xq2/Radius. The potential energy is equal to the negative ionization energy, and potential energy is always negative. Coulombs law therefore shows that an increase in the radius will decrease ionization energy. The charge between them can be measured through core charge. If the core charge is high, then the ionization energy will also be higher as it will take more energy to remove the electron.

The removal of each electron requires more energy than the last one, as the ionization energy is increasing. By removing an electron, the electron electron repulsion are reduced, which then mean that the electron is more attracted to the nucleus, and thus it takes more energy to pull away the electron. Additionally, the ionization energy appears to increase slightly between 3rd and 4th electron before a large increase between the 5th electron. For the 3rd and 4th electrons of silicon, the electrons are part of the same shell and thus, and thus have a very similar radius, and have the exact same core effective charge of +4, which is why the relatively small increase is only a result of reduced electron electron repulsion. The 5th electron is part of an inner shell, which is why there is an decrease in radius and increase in core effective charge as the core charge will be +12, as the shielding shell is now only the 1s shell. Electron -electron repulsions also decrease. This is why the ionization energy of the 5th electron is relatively much larger than the previous 3rd and 4th.

However, there is a large jump in magnitude from the fourth to fifth ionization energy. Since q1 (charge of nucleus) and q2 (charge of electron) from Coulomb's Law are staying constant, we can conclude that the radius must have had to decrease significantly to make up for this increase in ionization energy.

There is a significant jump in increasing ionization energy from the removal of the 4th to the 5th electron. This is because the 5th electron is removed from an inner subshell (2p), which is a significant decrease in distance between the electron and nucleus.

Decrease in electron-electron repulsion lowers the potential energy of the remaining electrons and thus greater IE is required to bring the energy of the electron to 0. The big jump between IE4 and IE5 can be explained by the decrease in r (the distance between the electron and the nucleus) and the increase in effective core charge (q1 = 12+). r and q1 are parameters in Coulomb's Law q1q2/r, an equation that allows us toÂ  determine the potential energy of the electron.

The second reason is according to Coulomb's law determining that potential energy is directly related to effective core charge and inversely related to radius. The third and fourth electrons removed from silicon both come from the 3rd shell. Therefore, they have the same radius and effective core charge (Zeff= 4) because both have the same number of shielding electrons. The significant difference in magnitude occurs in the 5th ionization because that electron comes from the 2nd shell. That electron has a significantly smaller radius and has a much higher core charge because there are only 2 shielding electrons. (Zeff = 12)",

Using Coulomb's law, less electron electron repulsion makes the potential energy of the electron more negative, so the ionization energy is greater. For the fourth and fifth electrons, the change is much larger, almost 4x greater. This implies that there is a change in the core charge and the distance of the electron from the nucleus. The core charge changes after the fourth electron is moved, and it goes from +4 to +12, increasing the attraction to the nucleus. The electron is now much closer to the nucleus, so using Coulomb's law, we can see the inversely proportional relationship between distance and attraction and how it increases the ionization energy. Overall, the smaller increases in ionization energy are caused by the fact that there is less electron electron repulsion and the larger changes are caused by changing shells.",
3864fd4c-6445-4bfa-add0-27f087d20bb6,"1) The successive ionization energies increase with every additional removal of an electron because every time an electron is removed from an atom, the total number of electrons decreases, which decreases the total electron-electron repulsion force on each electron, which increases the next removed electron's attraction towards the nucleus, making the necessary force required to ionize the electron greater than the last electron (which experienced greater electron repulsion).

2) Although each successive IE increases in magnitude, there is a relatively much larger jump in between the IEs of the fourth and fifth electron IEs. This is because before the Sodium atom removes its fourth electron , its electron configuration is 1s^22s^22p^63s^1, which makes the core charge felt by the removed electron 14 - 10=4 ; while before it removes its 5th electron the configuration is 1s^22s^22p^6, which makes the core charge felt by the removed electron 14 - 2=12. Since the core charge of the 5th electron removed is much greater, Coulomb's Law ((q1 x q2)/r) states the Ionization energy will be much greater, since they have a direct correlation. The distance (r) between the nucleus and the removed electron is also greater for the 4th removed electron because the electron furthest from the nucleus is in the third shell (as opposed to second for the 5th IE), and since Coulomb's Law states r is inversely correlated to PE, this also contributes to the much greater difference in IE. Comparatively, both electron removed for the 4th and 3rd IE are removed from the same subshell, so the core charge and radius would remain the same.",

So between the removal of the third and fourth electron there is additional energy required because of the change in radius.Â  Although the core charge is not changing according to columbs law IE is also dependent on radiusÂ  so the radius of the fourth electron being removed is smaller than that of the third electron being removed. When jumping between the fourth and fifth electron being removed there is a massive increase in the ionization. This is caused by the different shells the electrons are being removed from.

This is why the IE increases from the third to fourth electron removed, even though they are in the same subshell and feel the same core charge. In the case of the fifth electron removed, at that point the radius at which the electron is found is decreased massively, and the relative core charge the fifth electron to be removed feels is much less as the number of core electrons has changed.

The third, and fourth electron feel a core charge of +4 (Z=14-10=4) and their distance from the nucleus is not changing therefore electron-electron repulsion explains their increasing ionization energy. The less electrons that surround a nucleus, the less electron repulsion there will be thus each electron feels a slightly greater attraction towards the nucleus. The difference in ionization energies between the fourth and fifth electron removed is much greater than the difference between the third and fourth so based on Coulomb's law, the radius must decrease or the core charge must increase. The fifth electron is removed from a smaller radius to the nucleus and feels a greater effective core charge +12 (Z=14-2=12).

Furthermore, we have moved to an entirely different shell. For the fourth electron, the core charge will be the same, but because we are just now arriving to the second shell, it will take less energy to remove the electrons because we are not removing anything from a complete shell. As we move to the third shell, the core charge becomes +4, and it takes significantly less ionization energy to remove the electrons because the pull of the electrons to the core is not as strong. In terms of Coulomb's Law, we know that r will be larger and there will be a lesser q1, or core charge, the more electrons we remove. This results in knowing that ionization energy will decrease as we remove more electrons and the potential energy will increase.

2) The relative magnitudes of the values are as follows because there is going to be significantly more ionization energy required to move the fifth electron due to the core charge being greater and the once full shell losing an electron, disrupting the attraction to the core.

2) The ionization energy of from the third to the fourth electron of Silicon increases at a relatively stable number. The third electron is removed from the third shell (n=3) from the 3s sub shell and so is the fourth electron and so because both of these electrons are in the same shell, they feel the same core charge of +4 so their ionization energies are relatively close. This is further supported by Coulomb's law of -PE = q1q2/r with q1 being core charge, q2 electron charge, and r as the radius. Since the 3rd and 4th electron have the same core charge and relatively the same radius, there ionization energies are going to be very similar with an increase from the 3rd to 4th electron removed as a result of decreased electron-electron repulsions (which then increases ionization energy). However, the fourth electron's ionization energy is larger because not only does the decrease of electron-electron repulsions lowers the potential energy which then increases the ionization energy, the decrease in radius also plays a role. The large increase of ionization energy from the fourth to the fifth electron occurs because the fifth electron is no longer removed from the third shell (n=3), it is now removed from the second shell (n=2) from the 2p sub shell.

Between the fourth and fifth ionization energies however, there is a large increase of almost 3.7 times. This can be explained by the fifth electron being in the next shell down. This would both significantly increase effective nuclear charge and decrease radius, two main factors that would increase the ionization energy of an electron.

This means that the inner electrons, in this case the 5th electron, are more difficult to pull off the atom, shown by the huge increase in IE.",

48e38676-4ba3-456e-9ed4-65d8a75504f1,"1) The removal of each additional electron requires more energy because once an electron is removed, there is less e-e repulsion. As a result, potential energy decreases, and ionization energy increases. This is the reason for higher ionization energy of the fourth electron than the third. When electrons are being removed from a new shell (fifth electron), usually core charge increases and radius decreases, which means potential energy decreases using Coulomb's Law, and ionization energy increases a lot. Less e-e repulsion also takes a small part in increasing ionization energy.

2) The third and fourth ionization energies are similar because the core charge these atoms remains +3. These atoms exist also exist in the same 3s subshell, and based on q1q2/r, their potential energies, and therefore ionization energies, would be similar. However, decreased e-e repulsion means the 4th ionization energy is larger than the third. The reason the 4th ionization energy is about x3.69 larger than the previous one is because the core charge on that electron becomes +11. This is about x3.66 larger than the previous core charge of +3. The radius also decreases a lot because we have moved from the 3rd to the 2nd energy level. using Couloumb's Law again, we know that it has a much lower potential energy, and therefore much larger ionization energy.

Note: the ionization energy of the 5th electron is slightly larger than x3.66 the previous one because the radius and e-e repulsion also decrease.",
4b6af913-ce1d-44a0-9f8a-3fe9e225f017,"1) The removal of each additional electrons requires more energy because the process of removing successive electrons removes electron repulsion in the atom, therefore lowering the potential energy and increasing the ionization energy. In Coulomb's law, we can see this change because in the equation [PE = (q1q2)/r], theÂ  variable that is changing is q1 - the core charge.

Â 

2) We can see a steady increase in ionization energy values until we observe a huge jump from 4356 kJ/mol to 16091 kJ/mol. This huge jump is due to the change in shell of the atom. Also, it can once again be seen in Coulomb's Law where now the r variable also changes - it gets smaller as the core charge increases, but the radius is a much more notable change. This therefore causes a greater increase in ionization energy than previously noted.",
4b7207ef-491c-4ec6-b8b0-3d01774fc36f,"1) Coulomb's Law states that the potential energy of an electron is equal to (q1 x q2) / r, where q1 is the effective core charge the electron is experiencing from the atom's nucleus, q2 is the charge of the electron itself, and r is the distance between the nucleus and the electron. The successive ionization energies increase, therefore, because as more electrons are pulled away from the atom, there are less electron-electron repulsions acting on the electron to help counteract the core charge of the nucleus, so it takes more energy to pull the electron away. Additionally, with the diminishing of the repulsions and shielding of the other electrons, the electron in question is pulled closer to the nucleus by the attractive forces, meaning that the r value of Coulomb's Law gets smaller, which also increases the total ionization energy that is necessary.Â 

2) However, the third and fourth ionization energies appear to be relatively similar in magnitude, while the fifth undergoes a huge increases. This is because the third and fourth electrons to be removed were on the same energy level and therefore experienced roughly equivalent core charges at nearly identical distances from the nucleus. After those two, however, that electron shell ran out of electrons and therefore the fifth ionization energy was dealing with one out of eight valence electrons on the energy level below the fourth in fifth. As a result, the r value for the fifth ionization energy massively decreased in a manner that more than made up for the relative decrease in core charge experienced by the fifth electron, leading to a significantly higher ionization energy.",
4ceb40ea-149e-4246-86ac-09f73d420585,"1)Â  Coulomb's law represents that potential energy is equal to the core charge times an electron all over the radius. The core charge of Silicon is not changing as ionization is only the removal of electrons, but as its electrons are removed, its radius is decreasing, which would produce a lower potential energy, and inversely a higher ionization energy. As this process continues with each ionization of the atom, the removal of each additional electron would require more energy.

2) The magnitude of the 3rd and 4th ionization energies are similar in energy, however, the 5th ionization energy is much greater than the first two ionization energies. This is due to the 5th ionization energy being the removal of an electron in a lower orbital that is closer to the nucleus, which requires a lot more energy if we use Coulomb's law as the radius has then drastically decreased in size when compared to the differences in radius of the 3rd and 4th ionization energies.Â ",

4e163c8a-763a-4686-be2b-1346ec7664bb,"b) The ionization energies increase successively because electrons are being removed. The ionization energy of an electron is equivalent in magnitude to the potential energy of the same electron, where 0 is defined to be the potential energy of a free charge an infinite distance away from other charges. By coulomb's law, since electrons have the same (negative) charge, electron-electron repulsion raises electrons' potential energy. When electrons are removed by ionization, there is less electron-electron repulsion, so the electrons' potential energy is lowered and the remaining electrons require a greater ionization energy to be removed. The fourth IE is only 1.348 times greater than the 3rd IE because the only change between them is a decrease in electron-electron repulsion. However, the fifth IE is 3.694 times greater than the 4th IE because Silicon has only four valence electrons. For a fifth electron to be removed, it must come from an ""inner shell,"" with a significantly lower radius and potential energy, requiring a correspondingly higher ionization energy.",
4e9fc8ea-9731-45d8-aa3d-17a36743c30f,"1. The removal of each additional electron makes it so that there is less electron-electron repulsion for each electron, making it so that they are more strongly attracted to nucleus.Â  There is less interference from their pull to the positive charge, resulting in the electrons requiring more energy (IE) to be removed.

Additionally, the big jump from the 4th and 5th ionization energies can be explained from Coulomb's law, which shows us that an electron's potential energy can is dependent on its distance from the nucleusÂ  and the core charge it experiences. The 4th electron to be removed experiences a Zeff of +4 and is a farther from the nucleus, while the 5th electron has a Zeff of +12 and is in a lower shell closer to the nucleus.Â  The ionization energy will thus be much larger for the 5th electron compared to the 3rd and 4th, since its lower potential energy indicates that we need more energy to remove the atom.",
4ecb79c4-69c6-470f-9290-ab1454aa9794,"Coulomb's Law mathematically describes the strength of the attraction between two particles (protons in the nucleus and an electron in an orbital) a certain distance apart (atomic radius) with the equation (q1*q2)/r; q1 is the core charge, q2 is the charge of the electron (-1) and r is the radius measured from the nucleus to the orbital where the electron is located. The removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the removal of the previous one because as an electron is removed, the core charge has a stronger attraction to the electrons left in the atom's orbitals. The big jump in ionization energy between the fourth and fifth electrons is caused by the removal of a 2p orbital electron that has a smaller radius and less electron-electron repulsion than the higher energy 3s orbital.",

We know that successive ionization energy increases. As you pluck electrons from the outer shell of an atom, the core charge may be the same (#protons- #shielding electrons) and the radius will be the same, but there will be less electron - electron repulsion, lowering the potential energy and increasing the ionization energy required to pluck each additional electron. We also see that there is a large increase in the ionization energy required to remove the fifth electron. Knowing that Si has four valence electrons in its outermost shell, the fifth electron would be plucked from the next, inner shell. Moving from the outside shell to an inner shell results in a great decrease in the distance between the electron and the nucleus. Looking at coulomb's law, we can see that decreasing r results in a lower PE and a higher IE. Also we can see that the core charge increases. The number of protons (14) minus the # of shielding electrons (2) results in a +12 core charge, resulting in a lower PE.",
4f36e6f7-e590-4666-979c-8fd11ff066f9,"1) The removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the removal of the previous one because every time an electron is removed, the amount of electron-electron repulsion decreases. This results in the remaining electrons being more attracted to the nucleus and thus needing greater ionization energy for the removal of the next electron.

2) A neutral silicon atom has a core charge of 4. This is determined by nuclear charge - the number of shielding electrons (14-10). Coloumbs law describes that the nuclear attraction of the nucleus to an electron is determined by the distance between the two and the effective nuclear charge. (Zeff). The increase in relative magnitudes of the ionization energies observed when removing the third and fourth electron was not very large. Thus this increase in ionization energy can be chalked up to the reduction in electron-electron repulsion (there was less electron-electron repulsion when the 4th electron was being removed compared to when the 3rd electron was being removed). On the other hand, there is a large increase in ionization energy between the removal of the 4th and 5th electrons. This change must be due to a decrease in the radius and an increase in Zeff. The 5th electron removed must have resided in an inner shell, which would mean there would be fewer shielding electrons between the 5th electron and the nucleus (higher Zeff), and that the 5th electron removed is closer to the nucleus than the 4th electron removed.Â ",

Core charge calculation 5th -> +12

Core charge calculation 3rd -> +4

1) Each electron requires more energy than the removal of the previous because as you go closer to the nucleus, the core charge increase. For example the 3rd electron that was removed has a lower core charge than the 5th electron that was removed because as we removed an electron closer to the nucleus, it became more difficult and required more energy as there was more attraction between the electrons and the nucleus.

2) The ionization energies increase drastically from the 4th subshell to the 5th subshell because it becomes more difficult to remove electrons and there is a stronger attraction meaning a higher ionization energy.

This pulling force will remain constant because the amount of protons Silicon has in its nucleus and the amount of inner electrons will not change when ionizing the 3rd and 4th electrons. Coulomb's Law uses the charge of the particle multiplied by the core charge of element and divided by the atomic radius to determine energy. The determining factor in comparing the ionization energies of the 3rd and 4th electrons is the core charge. Because there is one less electron present when ionizing the fourth one (meaning the remaining electrons are able to feel the pull of the nucleus a little more with slightly less electron repulsion), we see a slight increase in ionization energy. We see an extremely large increase from the 4th ionization and 5th because with the 5th we are now ionizing an electron from a lower energy level.

The third and fourth electrons are both being removed from the n=3 shell of Silicon, so they experience similar effective core charge. However, once the third electron is removed from the valence shell, the remaining electrons experience lower electron-electron repulsions, making the attraction to the positively charged nucleus slightly stronger and very slightly decreasing the radius of the valence shell. Thus, by Coulomb's law (PE = q1q2/r) and IE=-PE, this slight decrease in radius will slightly increase the amount of energy needed to ionize the subsequent electron. The fifth electron to be removed comes from the n=2 shell. In comparison to the prior electrons, this electron comes from a valence shell with a significantly smaller radius. Additionally, this electron experiences a higher effective core charge due to the absence of as many shielding electrons.

Keeping that in mind, it can be deduced that while electrons from the same subshell have the same potential energy, their successive ionization energies must be higher due to less electron-electron repulsion (since electrons are being removed).

The relative magnitude of the 5th ionization energy is much larger than the 3rd or 4th.Â  This is because the core charge felt by the third and fourth electrons ionized is Zeff = 14 - 10 = 4 since there are 10 electrons shielding the nucleus, while the 5th electron that is ionized is in an electron shell closer to the nucleus, and it is only shielded from the nuclear charge by 2 electrons, so Zeff attracting it is 14 -2 = 12.

However, after the 5th ionization energy, the ionization energy is might higher which means that the radius must have reduced and the core charge must have increased.

This results in a larger core charge for the fifth ionization energy, which is the first atom in the 2p subshell.

The core charge for this inner shell is 10-2 = +8 whereas the core charge of the valence shell of Si is 14-10 = +4.

This is because inner shell electrons closer proximity to the nucleus ""shields"" outer electrons from some of the nucleus's attraction. When outer electrons are removed, the nucleus's attractive forces are working on fewer electrons, so as electrons are removed, it takes additional energy to overcome the nucleus's attraction. Additionally, Coulomb's Law demonstrates that as the distance between an electron and the nucleus decreases, the potential energy of that electron increases. Therefore, the fifth electron removed from an Si ion would have less potential energy than the 3rd or 4th because of its closeness to the nucleus, meaning that it would require a larger input of energy to remove it.

ionization is opposite of potential energy which is determined by the couloumb's law, it states that PeÂ  =Â  Q1 x Q2/R Q1 is the zeff and Q2 is the charge of the atom.Â 

I'll explain thirdÂ  to fourth ionization energy and fourth ionization energy seperately.

1) thirdÂ  to fourth ionization energy increase: this is due to less electron and electron repulsions between the shells of the atom. the less the electron electron repulsion, the bigger the ionization energy.

2)as we remove more electrons (higher ionization energies )from the atom, we are removing electrons closer to the nucleus. The fourth to fifth ionization increase is because the fifth is removing an electron in another inner shell than the fourth. Thus due to coulomb's law, when R decreases, Potential energy increases and so those ionization energy.

Â 

b. We noticed that the fifth ionization energies is a lot bigger than the previous two, that is because the fourth ionization energy removed the last electron in the 3s orbital,Â  the fifth ionization energy have to remove an electron from the 2p shell which requires significant more energy since it's closer to the nucleus.Â ",

When you remove the previous electron, there is less electron electron repulsion which means the remaining electrons have lower energy and hard to remove. The distance of the valence shell to the core will also decrease which increases the attraction between the electron and nucleus, making it harder to remove an electron.Â 

2) The relative magnitude of the values are significant in that ionization energies are not constant. We can observe that the difference in successive IEs are not by the same factors. For example, 3231 and 4356 kJ/mol are much closer in magnitude than 16091Â  and 4356 kJ/mol. This tells us that the third and fourth electrons are removed from a similar location (subshells). In ionized Silicon, the reason for this big jump is that all the valence electrons have been removed by the 5th ionization energy and thus an electron must be removed from the next inner shell.Â ",
61c0cc44-3833-4784-bf01-898bfd11c3bf,"1) Coulomb's Law indicates IE is influenced by two factors: radius and core charge. In order for ionization energy to increase, the radius between the electron and the nucleus must be becoming smaller. Secondly, the core charge can be found via [Z (atomic number) - inner shell electrons.] For electrons farther away from the atom, there are more inner shell electrons so the core charge is lower. When we move closer to the atom, the core charge increases because the number of inner shell electrons decreases. The increase in core charge and decrease in radius means that successive ionization energies increase.Â 

2) The relative magnitude of the ionization energies helps us understand information about where electrons in Si are located. The third and fourth ionization energies are distinct values, but comparable in magnitude. Between IE4 and IE5, there is a 400% increase, which indicates that that electron must be both closer to the nucleus and experiencing a higher core charge. This would suggest that electrons exist in ""shells""Â  of varying distances around the nucleus.Â ",

In the 2nd electron shell of Si, the core charge felt the electrons in that shell is +12, which is a lot greater than the core charge felt in the 3rd shell of Si, which is +4. Because of this drastic change in IE, we have two be going down in electron shell, as the core charge becomes significantly greater, which proportionally increases the IE.

When we see the 3rd and 4th IEs, there is only a slight change in the IE, which must mean that the core charge felt is not changing, as when that changes, it increases the IE drastically. This must mean that the radii between the 3rd and 4th IE electrons must be different, with the 4th IE one being slightly smaller, which in turn slightly increases the IE.

According to Coulomb's Law, electrons are given a negative energy to denote its potential energy within the atom. Assuming that core charge remains constant, successive ionization removes electron-electron repulsion that contribute positively to the electron's potential energy. Because ionization energy is the amount of energy needed to bring the potential energy to zero, successive ionization results in the next electron having lower potential energies and thus a higher ionization energy. However, there is a large difference in the ionization energies between the fourth and fifth electrons in silicon. This difference is caused by the fifth electron being closer to the nucleus than the fourth electron. According to Coulomb's Law, electrons closer to the nucleus result in a decrease or a more negative potential energy. This is also supported by core charge, as moving closer to the nucleus results in an increase in the core charge that affects the individual atom.

This is due to the fact that the third and fourth electrons are on the outer valence shell and the nuclear charge's effect on these electrons is dampened by shielding electrons on the inner core shells. This difference in core charges means that the fifth electron is much harder to remove because it is more strongly attracted to the nucleus.

1) Ionization energy increases between the removal of the third and fourth ions primarily due to the loss of electron-electron repulsion (upon the removal of one). If There isn't an electron in the same energy level to repel the ion, then the ionization energy will slightly increase as seen. As for the increase in IE from the fifth to fourth electron, this occurs because the fifth ionized electron resides in an inner shell relative to the 3rd and 4th ionized electron, and therefore has a higher effective core charge and smaller radius (which according to coulomb's law , is extremely conducive to high IE).

2) The relative magnitudes of the values observed correspond to the minimal electron-electron repulsion expereinced for the 3rd and 4th ionization energies, and the magnitude of the fifth ionization energy corresponds to the removal of an electron from a shell more inwards, relative to the 3rd and 4th electron's energy shell.Â ",

The large increase between the fourth and fifth ionization energies is due to a large increase in radius.

Successive ionization energies always increase, but an increase in the radius causes more of a change than a decrease in electron-electron repulsion.

8a50e4a2-9088-4e2c-9211-db6e8c280f2c,"As successive electrons are removed from Si, the ionization energy between the removal of the third and fourth electrons increases because there is a decrease in electron-electron repulsion between the electrons as they are on the same energy level, which is the valence shell of the atom. There is a sharp increase in the energy required to remove the fifth electrons compared to the energy required to remove the fourth electron. According to Coulomb's Law, an electron's potential energy depends on the core charge of the atom and the distance of the electron from the nucleus. This means that the energy required to remove the 5th electron increased drastically due to a decrease in the radius of the atom as well as increase in its core charge, which in turn decreases its potential energy since the electrons are more attracted to the positive nucleus, which in turn, results in a larger ionization energy. The relative magnitude of the ionization energies shows that the ionization energies for removing the 4th and 5th electrons from the Si atom are about 1.348x and 4.980x the energy required to remove the 3rd electron respectively.Â  The relatively small increase in ionization energy required to remove the 4th electron compared to the 3rd electron shows that both of these electrons are in the same energy level, while the sharp increase in energy required to ionize the 5th electron indicates that it's in a lower energy level. Since the core charge of the 5th electron is about 6 times greater than the core charge of the 3rd electron, it makes sense that the IE for the 5th electron was about 5x larger than that of the 3rd electron.Â ",

Looking at the ionization energies, there is a huge jump in the magnitude of the values observed because when you remove the fifth electron, it means the radius decreased, electron-electron repulsion decreased and the effective core charge also changed. All of these are factors that play into the large increase in ionization energy since radius is a huge part since the shell level is closer to the nucleus, affecting Coulomb's Law and making the ionization energy greater.",

The successive ionization energies here each require more energy to remove an electron because of the way these factors are changing each time an electron is removed. Each time an electron is removed, there are fewer electrons and less electron repulsion, so it requires more energy to remove the next. Additionally, each time one is removed, the core charge is able to pull more strongly on each remaining electron because the effect of positive charge is split between fewer electrons. In particular, this is why the ionization energy jumps so much between the fourth and fifth removed electrons, from 4356 to 16091 kJ/mol; at the 5th Ionization energy, the electron being removed is now in the lower principal energy level of 2 instead of 3, based on the electron configuration above. This means the electron has fewer shielding electrons between it and the core, increasing the attraction and therefore IE, as well as decreasing the radius since it is in a closer shell, also increasing IE. The bigger difference in these 2 factors from 4th to 5th IE (when the shell of the electron being removed changes, with fewer shielding electrons) compared to 3rd to 4th IE the explains the sudden jump.",

The fifth ionization energy corresponds to an electron in the n = 2 shell. In this shell, the number of protons in the nucleus (14) minus the number of shielding electrons (2) yields a far greater core charge of +12. The lower shell is also significantly closer to the nucleus, drastically decreasing the radius. Together, these both significantly decrease the potential energy of the electron by Coulomb's Law and drastically increases the ionization energy between the 4th and 5th ionization energies.

The fifth electron has a significantly higher ionization energy because it is removed from the lower n=2 shell, meaning that the core charge jumps to +12 (14-2) and it's closer to the nucleus than the 4th electron was, both of which contribute to higher Coulombic attraction between the fifth electron and the nucleus and make it harder to remove.",

Think of the Bohr model of the Si, in which n=1 has two electrons, n = 2 has 8 electrons, and n=3 has four electrons. By the time of the fourth ionization energy, n=3 has been picked clean of electrons, and the next IE must take an electron from n=2. The reason the IE spikes so dramatically becomes clear when we consider core charge. Core charge when IE was taking electrons from n=3 was (14-10 = +4), but core charge when IE is taking electrons from energy level n=2 is (14-2 = +12), which is a huge increase in the attractive force between the valence electrons and the positively charged nucleus (this is due to less shielding from inner electrons).Â 

Â 

Now the reason the fourth IE is a bit greater than the third is because, with removal of each electron, there is a lessened force of electron to electron repulsion, meaning that ionization energy will increase by a bit with each successive removal and both electrons are in the same subshell and energy level. If we look at the electron configuration of SiÂ  (1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^2), we can see that the third and fourth electrons to be removed would be in the 3s^2 subshell, meaning the IEs of both would be fairly similar due to the same core charge acting upon both.",

Since these remaining electrons feel more of an attraction to the nucleus it takes a higher IE to remove that electron from the stronger positive charge.

The large jump at the 4th to 5th electron removal is due to the IE having to overcome the smaller radius of an entirely new shell pulling the electron closer to the positively charged nucleus, creating a much stronger attractive force than removing the last electron from the previous shell. The smaller radius means that the electrons are closer to the nucleus than the previous shell, creating a stronger attractive force that has to be overcame by the IE.",

The larger change in relative magnitude between the fourth and fifth ionization energies can also be showcased with Zeff and oulomb's Law. Zeff for electron 4 being removed was +4, but Zeff for electron 5 being removed is + 12 (14 - 2). The fifth electron is experiencing much greater attraction to the nucleus, which indicates that the fifth electron is much closer to the nucleus than electron 4 (electron 5 only has 2 shielding electrons, while electron 4 had 10, so electron 5 is in a lower shell). Thus, the change in magnitude between the fourth and 5th ionization energies (16091/4356 = 3.69) can be explained by Zeff being three times greater for electron 5. Decreased electron-electron repulsion and the closer distance to the nucleus (r changes) causes the relative magnitude seen between the fourth and fifth ionization energies (repulsion alters the magnitude slightly from the expected 3x).",

Given that there are 5 valence electrons, we see that the energy required to remove the 5th electron is significantly higher than the other ones.

This increase can only be due to the inverse relationship displayed in Coulomb's Law between radius and potential energy. Because the radius increased, the potential energy was able to become much smaller (have a larger magnitude), which requires much more ionization energy to remove the electron.

Evident through the giant jump in magnitude between IE4 and IE5, this indicates that the electron feels a stronger attraction towards the nucleus. There are 4 electrons in the valence shell, therefore, the 5th electron comes from an inner shell which has a smaller radius. The core charge is 14- 2 for IE5 vs 14-10 for the IEs before that. A larger core charge correlates to a stronger attraction towards the nucleus.

The reason for the rather large jump in ionization energy from the removal of the fourth to the fifth electron is because the fifth electron is being removed from a different electron shell than the third and fourth ones. This electron shell has a smaller radius, and since Coulomb's Law requires that you divide by radius, a smaller radius will result in a higher ionization energy. The reason why the jump between the third and the fourth electron wasn't as big is because they were on the same electron sun-shell, and the only thing that really changed was the amount of electron-electron repulsion.Â ",
a59731a3-cb13-4264-a462-1648d4e6e251,"The ionization energy of an electron in an atom is dependent on the attraction of the nucleus of the atom, and the repulsion of the other electrons in the atom. This is because all of the electrons are negatively charged and thus repel each other. As a result of this, when an electron is ionized from an atom, the repulsive force that every other electron feels in the atom becomes smaller. Because of this, it requires a higher and higher energy to remove electrons, since they feel the same level of attraction to the nucleus but with less repulsion. The extremely large jump in ionization energies however, is due to something else. Since the core charge of an atom is determined by the number of protons minus the number of core electrons, it suddenly jumps, when all of the electrons are ionized off of an outer shell. This is because the number of core electrons drops by an entire shell level. For silicon, this happens after the fourth ionization since silicon only has four valence electrons making the fifth ionization energy extremely high as it is directly proportional to the core charge of an atom.",

1) The reason the removal of each electron allows for the next ionization energy to be greater than the last results from Coulomb's Law, since it notes that electron removal reduces the electron-electron repulsion in the electrons of an atom.Â  Knowing that Coulomb's law is V= ((q1)(q2))/rÂ and that a larger negative results indicates stronger attraction between two bodies, the removal of an electron-electron repulsion would raise the attraction by strengthening the overall attraction between nucleus and electrons, as electron-electron repulsion produces a positive result, reducing how negative overall attraction is.Â 

Â 

2) The reason for the slight jumps between electron 3 to 4 and the large jump in energy from 4 to 5 is because of subshells and levels. The removal of electron 3 to 4 happen from the 3s subshell, meaning both electrons feel a core charge pull of +4, since the innermost electrons does not change. However, the removal of electron 5 occurs from the 2p subshell, meaning that we have removed the entire n=3 shell and now have a core charge of +12, greatly raising the attraction between the nucleus and its electrons.Â Â ",

As each additional electron is removed the ionization energy increases because the electron to electron repulsion decreases. This means that the ionizing electron feels fewer repulsion from other electrons in the valence shell and therefore is more strongly connected to the nucleus. This explains the small increase from the third ionization energy to the fourth ionization energy of silicon. The removal of the third electron from the same subshell decreases the electron to electron repulsion felt by the fourth, which increases the ionization energy of the fourth electron. Additionally, when enough electrons are removed, the outer valence shell is gone, which causes a significant decrease in the radius of the atom and a significant decrease in the number of core electrons which ""shield"" the electron from the positive charge of the nucleus. This explains why there is such a large increase from the fourth ionization energy(4356 kj/mol) to the fifth ionization energy for silicon(16091 kj/mol). Silicon is losing its third shell as it loses the 4 electron, so the radius decreases and the effective core charge increases, causing the ionization energy to increase.Â ",

The core charge stays the same between IE 3 and 4 (core charge of +4), but that is no longer observed upon reaching IE5, where we now have a core charge of +10. Also, we observe a decrease in atomic radius due to our electrons feeling a much stronger attraction to the nucleus, and our electrons now being removed from a shell closer to the nucleus.

IE = ionization energy, PE = potential energy

1) Coulomb's law states that PE is related to q1*q2/r, in which q1 represents the core charge, q2 is the charge of an electron, and r is the radius. The values of the IEs depend on core charge, the size of the radius, and electron-electron repulsions. When the removal of an electron results in an electron configuration that is in the same principal level, the removal of each additional electron requires more energy because with each electron removed, the electron-electron repulsions are reduced, allowing the remaining electrons to feel a stronger attractive force to the nucleus. A greater attractive force means that a higher IE is required to ionize another electron. The radius stays similar in the same principal, so differences in radius are negligible.

When the removal of an electron results in an electron configuration that is in a lower principal level (e.g. 2 --> 1), a much higher IE is required because the radius dramatically decreases, dramatically lowers the PE (since in P related to q1q2/r, the radius gets smaller and increases the magnitude of PE) and thus dramatically increasing the IE required to remove the electron.

Â 

2) The two IEs corresponding with the removal of the third and fourth electrons are similar in magnitude because the radius stays similar while the electron-electron repulsions are reduced, resulting in a slightly larger value for the IE of the 4th electron than the 3rd electron. However, the removal of the 5th electron requires a dramatically greater IE because the radius decreases dramatically from n=3 to n=2, drastically lowering the PE and therefore drastically increasing the amount of IE required to ionize the electron.

Ionization energy increases successively with each electron removed due to the fact that the radius of the atom is getting smaller because there is less repulsion between electrons and more attraction to the positively-charged nucleus.

2. However, as observed in the values above, the relative magnitudes of the 3rd and 4th electron are removed are similar but the 5th electron removed has a much larger ionization energy.

Comparing the ionization energies for the 3rd and 4th electrons, we can see that there is an small increase between the two, about a factor of 1.35. This change is due to electron-electron repulsion. The core charge for both ionizations is still 4. As we remove electrons, we decrease the repulsive force between them. This causes an increase in the strength of the pull by the nucleus, increasing the ionization energy. The removal of the 5th electron has more to do with the radius component of Coulomb's law ( PE =(Q1Q2)/r)Â and a changing Zeff. However, there is still less electron-electron repulsion so that is a factor.

2) The 1.35x change from removing the third electron to removing the fourth electron is mostly due to electron-electron repulsion because the Zeff and the radius are similar, keeping the value from Coulomb's Law from changing drastically. However, there is a 3.69x increase from the removal of the fourth electron to the removal of the fifth electron. One reason for this can be attributed to a changing Zeff. The removal of the fifth electron occurs in a lower shell than the previous electrons.Â  This causes the Zeff to increase greatly, from 4 to 12. This massive change in effective nuclear force is one factor. Another factor is the decrease in the radius. As stated before, the 5th electron being removed is in a lower shell, meaning that the radius has decreased drastically. Looking at Coulomb's Law, we can see that a smaller radius leads to a lower potential energy, which leads to a higher IE. Because the shell is changing, the radius gets drastically smaller, leading to the substantial increase in IE.Â  Â ",
b792aa9e-2aae-420e-9679-9ce5fdd96b18,"In general, the removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the previous one because of the fact that whenever an electron is taken out, electron-electron repulsion decreases, and thus the remaining electrons can feel a stronger attraction to the nucleus. Furthermore, if the location from where the next electron is taken from is closer to the nucleus, then that electron feels a much greater core charge from the nucleus due to less electron shielding, and it's decreased distance from the nucleus allow that electron to feel more attraction (potential energy should be lower for these electrons if one does a Coulomb's law calculation then). In turn, since the energy to remove an electron increases as potential energy becomes more negative, much more energy would be required in this instance.

In this case the reason for the relative magnitudes of the values observed are because of where the third, fourth, and fifth electrons are located. Using the shell model of an atom, if we presume the third and fourth electrons to be in the same shell, then they are the same distance away from the nucleus and feel the same core charge. Thus, according to Coulomb's law, they should feel a similar attraction to the nucleus (their potential energies should be similar). As such, the increase in ionization energy for these electrons occur solely on the basis of decreased electron-electron repulsion. The fifth electron, on the other hand, has a large increase in ionization energy, and therefore should have a much more negative potential energy.

The core charge is also not changing because it is the same element, but the electron-electron repulsion is decreasing, because we are removing electrons. The decreased repulsion leads to an increased ionization energy.

The electron thus feels a much stronger attraction (higher core charge) and it requires more energy to ionize.

The successive increases in IE as we remove electrons from a Si atom are primarily due to reduction of electron-electron repulsion as there are fewer remaining electrons.Â 

The large jump in IE for Si4+ reveals that the fifth electron removed is in the next inner shell (3s^2). The core charge for this inner shell is much greater and the distance to the nucleus is smaller. Thus, by Coulomb's Law: PE = (q1*q2) / r, this produces a much lower PE (larger negative number) which, in effect, is a much larger IE.",

Because the attraction between the fifth electron and the nucleus is greater, it would take more energy to pull that electron away. The change in radius also is a factor, seeing as the radius from the fifth electron to the nucleus is smaller than the radius from the third and fourth to the nucleus.

This increase in core charge which is indicative of the pull that is felt by the electron from the nucleus is a good signal of an increase in ionization energy. In order with Coulomb's Law as well, as you get closer to the nucleus as is the case with the fifth removed electron, the potential energy of the electron decreases and because of PE's inverse relationship with IE this means that the ionization energy of the electron increases and it takes more effort to remove the electron from the atom. The relative magnitude of the ionization energies observed confirm this with the notable jump in value from the fourth to the fifth removed electron.

Originally, the atom had a core charge of +4 but removing 5 electrons means that all the outer shell electrons are taken away and now an inner shell electron has to be removed. Now because of that, the core charge is +12, which increases the Ionization Energy a bunch. Also when the outer shell electrons are taken away, the electrons that are next taken away are from the inner shel, which is closer to the nucleus and therefore have a lower r value, but this does not increase the ionization energy as much as the core charge does.",

The decrease in electron-electron repulsion leads to an increase in potential energy, causing the ionization energy to further decrease as there is less repulsion between the electrons.

However, between the fourth and the fifth ionization energies, there is a large increase in the energy required to remove the fifth electron because the fifth electron removed is in the next inner shell. The core charge for the fifth electron in the inner shell is greater (+12) compared to the core charge for the fourth electron in the valence shell (+4).

The removal of each additional electron requires more energy because the outermost electron has the longest radius from the nucleus.

The ionization energy starts to get larger compared to the removal of the previous one because the electron feels a greater nuclear charge due to its shorter distance from the nucleus. This requires a greater amount of energy to break away the electron. The relative magnitude of the values being observed can be explained by electrons three and four existing in the same subshell.

Furthermore, when ionizing electrons that are in the same shell, the core charge stays the same, but the number of electrons that the core charge is acting on decreases.

There is a significantly larger increase in the required ionization energy for this one because the 4th electron is in the 3s^2 subshell while the 5th electron is in the 2p^6 subshell.

For the third and fourth ionization energy, this is explained by the statement above. The radius is shrinking slightly each time. However, the fifth ionization energy jumps so greatly because it represents the ionization energy of an electron in a lower shell. When you move between shells, the radius decreases much more significantly than the removal of one electron from the outer shell.

As a result, this means that the ionization energy will increase. However, from IE4 to IE5, there is a massive increase in the ionization energy because the removal of a fifth electron would show that the electron is being removed from an inner shell and not the valence shell anymore, which would show this large increase in ionization energy. In other words, the reason for this large ionization energy increase from IE4 to IE5 is because the electron is in an inner shell which is much closer to the nucleus, and thus, this electron would have a much stronger attraction to the nucleus. This means that the potential energy is very low and thus the ionization energy must be very high as a result.Â ",

There is less electrons as we continue to ionize, which means that electron-electron repulsion reduces and ionization energy increases.

Because we know that coulombs law = (core charge)(charge of nucleus)/ radius, we know that as core charge increases so does ionization energy, and as radius increases ionization energy decreases. The increase in between the third and fourth ionization energies is small and can be attributed to electron-electron repulsion. However the change between the fourth and fifth energies is very large, and tells us that the radius must have become significantly smaller to make thee energy increase that much.

Since potential energy and ionization energy are inverses, this means that the ionization energy would also be 'more' positive, or increasing. Additionally, as electrons get removed, the electron-electron repulsions get weaker, which means that the radius gets slightly larger (since less repulsions keep the outermost electrons less attracted to the nucleus). If the radius is getting larger, according to Coulomb's law, the potential energy would become more negative, and the ionization energy would become less positive.

This phenomenon can be seen in the IE of the 3rd and 4th electron, as the increase in IE is not significant as a result of decrease in electron repulsion. We know that Potential Energy = (q1)(q2)/r, where q1 is the core charge of the atom, q2 is the negative charge of the electron, and r is the distance of the electron from the nucleus. This shows that when the 5th electron is removed, the significant increase in IE relative to the 3rd and 4th IE is caused by the decrease in the distance of the electron from the nucleus, as well as an increase in the core charge felt by the 5th electron, as the drop to a closer electron shell decreases the amount of shielding electrons between it and the nucleus and increasing attraction.Â ",

After the first two electrons are removed, the radius decreases because 3s becomes the outermost subshell. The same happens for the 2p subshell once the third and fourth electrons are ionized. This increases the ionization energy since the energy is inversely related to radius (since q1 and q2 are divided by radius). Additionally, since the first and second electrons have been removed, the third and fourth feel a stronger core charge because there are less shielding electrons between them and the nucleus. This increases q1. This also is seen in the fifth ionization energy, but since the 2p shell can hold more electrons than the 3s shell, there are less shielding electrons which explains the large jump in ionization energy from the 4th to 5th electron.Â 

2. There is an increase from the 3rd to 4th electron even though they are in the same subshell because electron-electron repulsion decreases ionization energy, so once the 3rd electron is removed the 4th does not experience electron-electron repulsion, so the ionization energy is greater than the 3rd. There is a large jump to the 5th because it's a new subshell with a smaller radius and less shielding electrons (explained above).",
d393da96-1782-425a-bf97-66b5068a8860,"1) The successive increase in ionization energy as more electron been removed is mainly due to less electron-electron repulsion that decreases the ionization energy. But when a new electron removed is in the next inner shell, the decrease in radius and increase in core charge also contribute to the successive increase in ionization energy but in a big jump.

2) The ionization energies to remove the third and fourth electrons are similar while there's a big jump between the fourth and fifth ionization energy. The similarity between IE3 and IE4 is because they are in the same shell, so the increase in IE is mainly due to the decrease in electron-electron repulsion when an additional electron been removed. But the big jump from IE4 to IE5 is because the fifth electron being removed is in a more inner shell than the fourth, and therefore has a more negative potential energy and thus a higher ionization energy. According to Coulomb's Law, PE = -q1q2/r, the potential energy is affected by both the radius and charge. The fifth electron is much closer to the nucleus because it's in a more inner shell, so its radius is smaller. And the core charge felt by the fifth electron (+8) is larger than the core charge for the fourth electron (only +1). Both decreasing in radius and increasing in core charge when moving to a more inner shell make IE5 so much greater than IE4.",
d3aef318-c88a-46ae-a31c-32c01dec7c2b,"The removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the previous one because the potential energy of the next electron is lower which means that it requires more energy to be ionized. From the 1st to the 3rd electron ionized, the ionization energy increases because there is less electron-electron repulsion but the core charge is the same, +8. Therefore, the electrons feel the same pull from the nucleus but feel less repel from other electrons which leads them to be more strongly attracted to the nucleus. The third and fourth ionization are relatively close to one another because the core charge they feel is the same. The slight difference is due to the fact that they feel less electron repulsion. We observe the big jump in the fifth ionization energy because this electron is in the second shell with a much smaller radius and because it feels a much stronger core charge. Coulumb's law shows that a smaller radius and a higher core effective charge lead to a more negative potential energy. The fifth electron is closer to the nucleus and it feels a core charge of +12.Â ",
d3c17e28-9a5a-49e5-b9eb-5ca21a8ed567,"Based on core charge calculations and the Coulomb's Law, the removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the removal of the previous one. As each additional electron is ionized, this reduces the electron-electron repulsion among all the different atoms. In addition, from the fourth to fifth electron, there is a significant increase, as it shows how the fifth electron is actually in a lower electron shell compared to the previous electrons, which according to Coulomb's Law, will make the radius smaller, thus the potential energy lower, and overall the ionization energy higher.

You can see the relative magnitude of the values observed. If you calculate the core charges felt by the electrons across the three different ionization energies, you can see that it equals, respectively,Â  +4, +4, and +12, respectively. Thus, if you compare the fourth and fifth ionization energies, there is a significant increase, as if you also compare the fourth and fifth core charges, there is a difference by a factor of three. On the other hand, the difference between the third and the second ionization energies are relatively small, as their core charges remained the same.Â ",
d5cb218e-3d22-4678-aadb-5040df7c99a0,"Si has 14 protons and therefore when neutral has 14 electrons. When 5 electrons are removed, Si still has 14 protons, but the effective core charge felt by the remaining electrons becomes much greater because there are fewer shielding electrons between the outermost electrons and the nucleus.

Therefore, IE4 is slightly larger than IE3 because the fourth electron to be removed takes just slightly more energy to remove than the third electron -- because electron-electron repulsion decreases, increasing the ionization energy required to removed the fourth electron(as seen in the (q1)(q2) part of Coulomb's law). IE5 is much larger because the fifth electron takes much more energy to remove, because the radius of Si changes significantly at that point, from a 3s to a 2p subshell.",

d6e47efe-68f8-4c6c-9231-f10a5a69292c,"1) Coulomb's Law states that the attraction felt between two entities is determined by their respective charges divided by the distance between them. In this case, we're looking at Coulomb's Law with an electron and a nucleus. Each removal of individual electrons requires more energy because each time an electron is removed, electron-electron repulsion is decreased, therefore increasing the attraction between the electrons in the shell and the nucleus. Furthermore, although the radius does change, it's negligible compared to the change in attraction. That is, unless we've removed all the electrons in a valence shell and are now removing from a lower shell. In this case, the formal charge is very large since there are more protons than inner electrons, and also the radius is smaller since we ""jumped"" to a lower shell.

Â 

2) The 3 and 4th ionization energies here show an increase because of the decreased electron-electron repulsion as you remove more electrons. The big jump between 4356 and 16091 kJ/mol is because of the jump in energy shells. After the fourth electron is removed, we have removed all the electrons from the valence shell and the next electron removed, the fifth, is in a lower shell. Its core charge would be (14-2) = 12, and its radius is smaller than previous ionization energies since we're now removing from a lower shell, which would make the IE much larger.",

Coulombs Law states that the potential energy of an electron equals (q1 x q2)/r.Â 

If we combine the information above we can draw the following conclusion; for the first 4 successive ionization energies of Si, the ionization energy will increase gradually. This is because the radius remains the same, and so does the core effective charge, but the electron-electron repulsion will decrease, causing the IE to increase successively. When we remove the fifth electron, however, we will see a more significant increase in IE. This is because the radius has shrunk as we are now removing an electron from the next shell. The core effective charge also increases from +4 to 14 - 2 = +12, altogether resulting in a drastic IE increase.Â

The potential energy of electrons in an atom is based on the attraction of the positively charged nucleus, which results in a negative potential energy (negative electron charge x positive nucleus charge). This potential energy is decreased by the repulsive interactions between electrons (negative x negative=positive), or electron-electron repulsion. This explains (1) why the removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the removal of the previous one. Once one electron has been removed, the potential energy of the remaining electrons is lowered because there is less electron-electron repulsion.Â  Thus, the ionization energy needed to remove that electron increases.

The relative magnitude of the values observed (2) is caused by a decrease in radius between the location of the fourth and fifth electrons.

The decrease in radius for the 5th electron results in a much larger ionization energy, as demonstrated by Coulomb's law-- when q1q2Â is divided by a significantly smaller r, the electron's potential energy is lower (a larger negative number), and therefore takes a much larger ionization energy to remove.",

For the third and fourth ionization energies of silicon, the electrons are being removed from the same valence shell. The radius stays relatively constant, so the increase in IE is attributed to the decreased in electron-electron repulsion. Hence, the magnitude of these energies is very similar. The atoms' attraction to the nucleus increases and lowering the potential energy, making it harder to remove a consecutive electron. As for the fifth ionization energy, the large jump is tied to the fact that the electron is being pulled from an inner shell. The radius drops significantly and the core charge increases from +4 to +12. These changes contribute to the heightened magnitude of the fifth IE. The relative magnitude of the values is observed because the potential energy is a negative value to being with.

The removal of the fourth electron requires more energy than the removal of the third electron (4356kJ/mol vs. 3231 kJ/mol) because of the decrease in electron-electron repulsion. Electrons are negative, and thus repel each other, so the presence of other electrons means that it requires less energy to remove an electron from the positive nucleus. For the third and fourth electrons removed, the core charge is the same (as the number of protons and number of shielding electrons does not change) and the radius remains relatively constant (as the electrons are being removed from the same shell and sub-shell). So, q1q2/r will remain relatively constant; electron-electron repulsion contributes most to the jump in ionization energy between the third and fourth electron.

The removal of the fifth electron requires a LOT more energy than the previous two (16091kJ/mol). This is because the fifth electron lies in an inner shell (2p instead of 3s). So, there is an increased core charge on this electron (as there are less shielding electrons), the radius is smaller (inner shells are closer to the nucleus), and there is again less electron-electron repulsion, all of which contributes to the large increase in ionization energy (although the core charge and radius are the two major factors).Â ",

The reason for the large increase in the magnitude of ionization energy between the fourth and fifth IE is the large decrease in radius and increase in core charge. After the fourth ionization energy, a valence shell is lost, greatly decreasing the radius. Along with this, the core charge starkly increases as there is now a new valence shell full of electrons. According to Coulomb's Law, these two things would greatly lower the potential energy, therefore, increasing the ionization energy.

We can see that there is a much larger magnitude of a difference in IE for the fourth and fifth electrons, so this must be due to more than just e-e repulsion. This must be due to a large decrease in radius and increase in effective core charge because the 5th electron being removed is being removed from an inner shell, which is closer to the nucleus and thus has a smaller radius. It also has a higher core charge because the core charge is now 14 - 2 = 12, instead of 4 previously because there are less shielding electrons so the electrons' attraction to the nucleus is greater. Because PE is -q1q2/r using Coulomb's law, these 2 factors (decreasing radius and increasing core charge) will decrease PE (a larger negative number) which thus makes ionization energy a lot bigger because more energy is needed to bring PE to 0.Â ",
ee5ee66a-ffb1-43f5-a43f-066daf334377,"Coulomb's law explains that the potential energy of an electron is related to its attraction to the nucleus and the distance from the nucleus, and it helps account for raised potential energies due to electron-electron repulsion. Ionization energy is the energy needed to raise the PE of an electron to 0, as the PE of an electron is a negative number due to the nucleus being positive and the electron being negative. The reason that the removal of each additional electron requires more energy than the removal of the previous one is because there are less electrons present, which decreases electron-electron repulsion, which lowers the PE, raising the IE. The third and fourth IE represent a removal from an electron in the same shell, as the difference is not too drastic, meaning their attractions to the nucleus (core charge), and distances from the nucleus (r), are similar, meaning they are in the same shell (reason they are different is because less e-e repulsion), the valence shell. However, the large magnitude difference between the fifth and fourth electron implies that the 5th electron is being removed from a location much closer to the nucleus (implying this electron exists in a different shell with a smaller r), and that it feels a greater core charge since the shielding electrons are fewer.",
ee728e2a-c53c-4376-a2d0-5fe4c3f5d5fb,"1) An electron is removed with each successive ionization energy. Once that electron is removed, it decreases the electron-electron repulsion for the remaining electrons. If this observation is integrated into Coulomb's law, in which lessened electron repulsion yield a larger magnitude potential energy between an outermost electron and the nucleus, then each additional ionization energy in succession with the last will be higher.Â 

Â 

2) In the values observed above, the third and fourth ionization energies are clearly different, but there is a much more significant leap between the fourth and fifth ionization energies. This indicates that, according to Coulomb's law, the 5th ionization energy must be due to an atom experiencing either a much larger effective core charge, smaller radius to the nucleus, or lessen electron repulsion. With the electron shell model, we see that there exists a combination of the three. In that, the electron from the 5th ionization energy exists in the 2p subshell, while those from the 3rd and 4th exist in the 3s subshell. Because the 3rd and 4th were roughly within the same radius, only experiencing different electron repulsions, they had much more comparable ionization energies. Meanwhile, the 5th electron existed in a shell with a much smaller radius in respect to the nucleus, increasing the magnitude of its potential energy, and making it much harder to remove.Â ",

The core charge of silicon remains the same even as electrons are being removed. The removal of each electron creates more attraction to the nucleus for the electron. In addition, as more electrons get removed, there are less electron-electron repulsions (these would decrease the ionization energy). The removal of these electrons would shrink the radius due to the removal of the electron-electron repulsions, increasing the ionization energy, but only slightly.

Â 

2)

Although the third and fourth ionization energies are increasing, there is a sudden jump up to 16091 kJ/mol for the fifth ionization energy. This is because the electron being removed is coming from the n = 2 electron shell, when it was originally being removed from the n = 3 electron shell for the third and fourth ionization energies. The Coulombic attraction between the electron and the nucleus is much stronger in this inner electron shell because the radius between the electron and nucleus is smaller than it was originally.",
efed073e-e575-467d-b4d4-bef6a057b9f9,"1) PE as calculated by Coulomb's Law is the core charge multiplied by the charge of the electron all divided by the radius, and IE is the negative value of PE. This means that core charge is directly related to IE, so when core charge increases IE increases. When an electron is removed from an atom, this reduces the electron-electron repulsion in the atom which increases the nuclear attraction felt by the remaining electrons, thereby increasing the IE required to remove the next electron.Â 

2) The IE for the 5th electron removed is significantly larger than the IE for the 4th electron removed. This is because Si has 4 valence electrons, so after the 4th electron has been removed, the next electron to be removed is coming from an inner shell as the valence shell has been completely emptied. This inner shell is a much closer distance to the nucleus, and as shown in Coulomb's law, a lower radius (distance from nucleus) increases IE. Also, the core charge increases from (14 - 10 = 4) +4 to (14 - 2 = 12 ) +12 and this increase as shown through Coulomb's Law results in an increase in IE. Between the 3rd and 4th electrons removed, since they're in the same shell the core charge and radius remains the same. However, the electron-electron repulsion reduces between the 3rd ionization and 4th ionization which increases the IE by a less significant amount.",
f06e45c3-0a42-4ad6-938c-1a2cfe5f8a65,"Ionization energies of electron are determined by the core charge felt by the electron, the amount of electron repulsion in the atom, and the distance the atom is from the positively charged nucleus. Removing electrons successively along the same energy shell will decrease the amount of electrons in an atom and increase the atom's effective core charge. This corresponds with a lower potential energy, which requires a larger potential energy to overcome. Additionally, once enough electrons have been removed that lower energy shells become available, there is a decrease electron repulsion that creates a much more strongly felt attraction to the nucleus. This explains the large increase observe fifth ionization of Si; it's fifth electron is located within a lower shell that is has less electron repulsion then those of the other previously ionized electrons and it feels a stronger attraction to the nucleus, which requires a massive increase in ionizing energy to seperate.",
f0de5f37-8bc5-478a-97e9-5c6a9309ec2b,"Coulomb's law states that the factors affecting ionization energy are the core charge of an atom, the radius of the electron shell from which it is ionizing the atom, and the electron electron repulsion on the shells. Th removal of each energy increases in this case because the electron electron repulsion decreases as each electron is being removed causing a stronger attraction to the nucleus. It increases only a little from the third to the fourth ionization energy, however we witness a huge jump between the fourth and the fifth ionization energy. Since we know the factors that influence ionization energy based on Coulomb's law, and we know the impact that electron electron repulsion has on IE, we know this must be due to either a change in core charge and/or in the radius. We can then conclude that this fifth Ionization energy must have come from a completely different shell with a much smaller radius and a much larger core charge.Â ",
f10e4fbd-8fec-485b-ace4-3059a9bc4a33,"The removal of additional electrons requires more energy than the previous one because each electron that is removed feels less electron-electron repulsion than the one before. The electron being removed feels an attraction to the core positive nucleus, which is somewhat offset by a repulsion from the other electrons. The core positive attraction remains the same while the electron repulsion decreases, causing a steady increase in ionization energy. The large jump seen from the fourth and fifth electron ionization energy is due to the jump from a valence to a core electron. Coulomb's law is the charges of each particle divided by the radius. When moving from an electron in the valence shell to one in a shell closer to the nucleus, the radius dramatically decreases, causing a large increase in ionization energy. Â ",
f10f9648-ab50-42c8-934d-2dd04858b10b,"Within an atom, the electrons repel each other (called electron repulsion). This repulsion weakens each electron's individual attraction to the nucleus, thus each time an electron is removed, there is less overall electron-electron repulsion and each individual electron's attraction to the nucleus increases, requiring more energy to ionize. Coulomb's Law is represented mathematically as PE = (Q1xQ2)/r. In the equation, Q1 is the core charge and Q2 is the charge of the electron (-1) and r is the radius. Although Coulomb's Law reveals PE, we know that because an electron is at a negative energy, a lower PE must correlate to a higher IE. The ionization energy is similar between the third and fourth ionizations but sharply increases at the fifth.Â This correlates to Coulomb's Law, in which the core charge correspondingly shows a sharp increase as well. For example, the relative magnitude of IE between the fifth and fourth ionizations is roughly 3.7x and the core charge difference is about 3x more, suggesting a correlation. A sharp drop in the radius size (by dropping to a lower energy shell)Â between the fourth and fifth ionizationsÂ would also sharply increase the IE as well. Â Â ",

Removing the 3rd electron corresponds to removing the first electron from the 3s subshell. This value is the smallest ionization energy because this electron is the farthest electron of the three described from the nucleus, meaning it has the weakest attraction to the nucleus. The core charge it feels is +4, which is relatively high, but the larger radius and presence of electron-electron repulsion works to lower the ionization energy. The 4th ionization energy corresponds to removing the remaining electron in the 3s subshell. This electron feels the same core charge, and change in radius is negligible. However, because this is the only electron in the subshell, it does not feel electron-electron repulsion, meaning that its ionization energy is higher than IE3. The 5th ionization energy corresponds to removing the first electron from the 2p subshell. The core charge felt by this electron is +12 and the radius is now much smaller, meaning that the electron is very tightly held to the nucleus. We would expect the magnitude of IE5 to be 3x as large as IE4 because core charge is 3x as large, but this is not true due to the presence of electron-electron repulsion felt by the 2p electron, which raises PE and lowers Ionization energy slightly.Â ",

The 5th electron takes significantly more energy to remove than the 4th electron because it s being removed from the 2p subshell, which is closer to the nucleus than the 3s subshell (which means increased potential energy because of Coulomb's law), and also experiences a higher effective core charge of +12 as opposed to the +4 that the 3s subshell experiences.

This is validated by Coulomb's law (IE = (q1*q2) / r, where q1 is the core charge, q2 is the charge of an electron,, and r is the radius), because all the values will be relatively similar for these two IEs. However, a reduction in electron-electron repulsion makes the second value large (as stated above). The fifth IE value is really large compared to the other two because this electron was removed from a shell (an area) closer to the nucleus than the others.

As far as this data set for the ionization of Si, the ionization energies of the third and fourth electrons are close in magnitude, because Si has 4 valence electrons, thus both of these electrons resided in the valence shell. The large difference in magnitude between ionization energies of the 4th and 5th electrons removed occurs because the 5th electron is in a lower energy level than the 4th.

When analyzing the third, fourth, and fifth ionization energies of Silicon, there is a large jump in magnitude between the fourth and fifth energy.

This accounts for the increase in Ionization energies for the first four electrons, but it can be noted that there is a large jump in magnitude for the fifth ionization energy -- this is as a result of both a larger core charge and smaller radius of the atom.
