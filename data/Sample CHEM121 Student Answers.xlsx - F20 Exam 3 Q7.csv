sis_id,"424062: A CHEM 121 student was asked what hybrid orbitals must be present to form methanimine (CH2NH), for which a correct Lewis structure is shown below:

TheÂ student responded:
According to valence bond theory, Carbon cannot form four bonds because it only has two unpaired valence electrons. So, it has to form four sp3 hybrid orbitals to create the four bonds. Nitrogen doesnâ€™t need to hybridize because it already has three unpaired 2p valence electrons to form the three bonds with Carbon and Hydrogen.Â 
Assess the accuracy and logic of the studentâ€™s response: briefly explain whether the reasoning presented is logical, noting what information is correct or incorrect and providing correct logical reasoning and explanation where needed.
This question can be reasonably answered in 150 words or fewer.","Sentence 1 is correct. Valence bond theory describes that atomic orbitals must be half-filled to participate in covalent bonding.
Sentence 2: Correct number of hybrid orbitals. In this molecule, carbon must form three hybrid orbitals to form three electron domains.
Sentence 2: Correct type of hybrid orbitals. Carbon must form sp2 hybrid orbitals (from using a 2s and two 2p orbitals)
Sentence 3: Correctly states that nitrogen is hybridized
Sentence 3: Correct type of hybridization. Nitrogen is sp2 hybridized to form 3 electron domains
Sentence 3: Correct description of hybrid orbital bonds in nitrogen. Two sp2 orbitals form two sigma bonds.
Sentence 3: Correct description of unhybridized orbital bonds in nitrogen. Unhybridized p orbital forms pi bond"

Nitrogen does has three unpaired 2p valence electrons.",
58b80aca-180a-4611-9ac4-1df8db702d2f,"Sentence 1: This is incorrect, valence bond theory dictates that carbon cannot form 4 bonds because its valence electrons only occupy 3 atomic orbitals, one 2s and two 2p orbitals, and therefore atomic orbital overlap would only account for Carbon having three bonds.

Sentence 2: This is not correct, while carbon has 4 bonds it only has 3 electron domains around it and therefore undergoes sp^2 hybridization to form three sp^2 orbitals. Two of these orbitals form the single bonds with H while the remaining sp^2 orbital alongside a pi bond created between the unhybridized 2p orbitals in carbon and nitrogen form a double bond.

Sentence 3: This is incorrect, Nitrogen does in fact undergo sp^2 hybridization as it has three electron domains around it. One of the three sp^2 orbitals facilitates the single N-H bond while another sp^2 orbital in conjuction with a remaning 2p orbital in the same plane of carbon's 2p form a double bond between nitrogen and carbon.",

The second statement is not true but. itcompletely illogical. The logic reside in the fact that because VBT does not correlated with VSEPR we must define the molecule using a new theory , HO theory. in this case since the carbon must form a trigonal planar arrangement by VSEPR, IT MUST hybridize 1 s orbital and 2 p orbitals creating 3 hybrid sp2 M orbitals. The third statement is also inaccurate and somewhat illogical in that while the nitrogen atom already has 3 valence electrons that are unpaired and can form the necessary bonds by overlapping its half filled p orbitals, these three orbitals are oriented perpendicular to one another along three different axes. this would lead to the prediction of a different geometry and bind angle than what is described by the molecule given. In this case, we would need hybrid orbitals which thereby characterizes sigma bonds as the overlap of hybridized orbitals and pi bonds as the overlap of unhybridized orbitals. iN this sense the nitrogen would need to hybridize its 2s orbital with 2 of its 2p orbitals to form 3 hybrid sp2 orbitals.

2. False. The Carbon has 3 electron densities according to the lewis structure so it forms 3 sp2 hybrid orbitals, because the number of electron densities should equal the number of hybrid orbitals.Â 

3. Although the Nitrogen does have three unpaired 2p valence electrons, it still forms hybrid orbitals to bond with the carbon and hydrogen. The Nitrogen will form 3 sp2 hybrid orbitals and will have 1 p orbital to form the head-on sigma bond (with an sp2 from each) and a pi bond with the p orbitals from each creating the double bond with hydrogen.",

Three sp2 hybrid orbitals are formed to create 3 sigma bonds, and the un-hybridized p orbital is used to create the pi bond between carbon and nitrogen, allowing double bond to take place.

843d0446-3f17-40a6-84fd-f28b48be56a9,"Sentence 1: correct because electron configuration of Carbon is 1s22s22p2, so only the two electrons in two of the three 2p orbitals are unpaired. Valence Bond Theory describes that a bond forms when an atomic orbital (AO) of one atom overlaps with an AO of another atom to yield a pair of electrons shared between these two atoms. Since Carbon only have 2 unpaired electrons, valence bond theory would predict carbon to only form two bonds.

Sentence 2: sentence itself is correct, but is not the case of CH2NH. In order for carbon to form 4 bonds, it has to create 4 sp3 orbitals, each with one electron in it, to form 4 bonds with with other atoms. However, carbon in CH2NH takes a sp2 hybridization instead of sp3 because there is a double bond between C and N (one sigma and one pi), it forms three sigma bonds (which each come from the overlap of an sp2 orbital of carbon and an orbital from the other atom) and one pi bond (which comes from the overlap from the remaining p bond of carbon and an orbital from nitrogen). Therefore, only 2 2p orbitals are involved in hybridization, so carbon takes sp2 hybridization rather than sp3.

Sentence 3: incorrect. Because there is a double bond between Carbon and Nitrogen (in which one bond is sigma and another is pi), Nitrogen in this case takes form of sp2 hybridization, forming 3 sp2 orbitals with the 2s orbital and 2 2p orbitals, leaving one 2p orbital to form the pi bond.",

2. This is inaccurate. Carbon would form three sp2 hybrid orbitals because the Carbon atom has 3 electron domains, so there should be three hybrid orbitals that correspond to sp2 due to the trigonal planar geometry of 3 domains.Â 

3. This is inaccurate.

2.) This sentence is incorrect. There are three electron domains around carbon, so one s orbital and two p orbitals would hybridize to form three sp2 orbitals.

Sentence three is incorrect. Nitrogen has three electron domains, so it will hybridize into sp2 as well, where it will have a lone pair of electrons and three unpaired electrons for bonding.",

2. Incorrect. In methanimine, Carbon has 3 electron domains. Therefore, Carbon must form 3 hybrid sp2 orbitals (1 s, 2 p = 3).

This forms the model we know of Carbon in which it typically forms 4 bonds.Â 

3. Incorrect. Nitrogen does hybridize. In the molecule, it has 3 electron domains, so 3 sp2 orbitals are formed. However, 4 orbitals are needed, so Nitrogen also forms a 2p orbital in the molecule.
