Think about it, if the energy level above the one that the electron is currently is like let's say -6 eV and the one that the electron is at is at like -10 eV, then the electron will be needed to be hit with a frequency of light that is 4 eV to get to the -6 eV. If it is not exactly 4 then it wont be able to catch on to that energy level. However when you are ejecting an electron, you are not trying to reach a specific energy level, you are just trying to get out of the atom, so the frequency that you need is the frequency required to get out of the atom Once the electron is out of the atom, it is out. So the frequency does not really matter after that point that the electron is out of the atom. It is just an added bonus. The frequency of the light correlates with its energy, especially kinetic energy. The more the frequency the faster it will go. The threshold frequency is simply how much energy the electron needs to break free from the prison of the atom. If the electron has more energy than it needs, then it does not matter and it will continue to break free.Â ",

In terms of KE, the atom after being hit with its minimum threshold frequency emits an increase of KE in terms of photoelectrons. Thus, the second statement is flawed to an extent because although atoms must hit a minimum threshold frequency to emit photoelectrons, it implies that it can absorb any value above its threshold and respond in the same way (it also doesn't distinguish between photoelectrons and electrons).",

In other words, the removal of an electron only depends on the maximum amount of energy that can be absorbed by an electron (depending on frequency), and once that maximum is set, it can then be removed regardless of how much higher said frequency is.

In contrast, in order to remove an electron from an atom entirely, all you have to do is meet a threshold frequency.

If the light is being used to ionize the electron, the minimum frequency of light is the lowest energy required to remove it from the entire atom.

And as the electron moved to a lower energy state, energy is released, but only certain frequencies were recorded. Only certain frequencies indicate only certain energies, and we can conclude then that there are quantized energy levels.

From the electric effect, we knew that light has to overcome a threshold frequency to be able to eject and electron. Knowing the frequency of the light shot at the atom and the Kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectron, we were able to determine the energy required to remove an electron, or the IE. The reason ""any value of the minimum threshold frequency can be absorbed"" is because that energy, after fulfilling the IE is left as Kinetic energy of the photoelectron.",

This is not the case for the photoelectric effect however, as the electrons ejected from an atom are no longer bound by the atom. Because of this, any extra energy from the photon that is larger than the threshold frequency, is instead converted to kinetic energy for the electron. This difference in the absorption in energy is due to the difference in emitted particles. Photons are emitted when energy levels change, as opposed to electrons just being fully ejected.",

Photoemission spectrum Â  proved that electrons can only exist at specific energy levels, or shells. Moreover, these shells can be divided into subsehells. For an atom to emit light the electrons must be excited, enter a higher shell, and then to release this energy obeying law of conservation of energy release light as it moves to a lower, energetically more favorable state.

The first is photoemission, where energy is put into the atoms as photons. since atoms have certain areas where electrons can exist, the electrons can jump from one shell to a higher one when excited with the energy from the photon. When the electrons get excited, they do not move off of the atom, they only move to an unstable, higher shell. Because we observe that atoms only emit certain wavelengths, we conclude that the atoms can only absorb certain frequencies that the photon can give for the electron to absorb to later emit light at the same frequency. This is because electrons can only occupy certain areas within an atom, so they can only absorb as much energy as will take them to an area where they are allowed to be.

the second statement is talking about photoelectron emission, which is a completely different observation. This is when Einstein took a piece of metal and shone a light of a certain frequency (v) on it. he noticed that the electrons (measured by current) were only emitted after a certain frequency had been reached. The additional energy added after the electron is ejected is converted to KE/speed. So there is a certain frequency that the light has to give to the electrons for them to leave the substance, but once they do, any leftover energy turns into speed (light E = IE+KE). this proves that photons exist as a particle, because if it was a wave you would get constructive interference and also there wouldnt be a need for a threshold v.Â ",

This implies only fixed and specific transitions can occur between energy levels for electrons, as only certain amounts of energy can be absorbed, or emitted. If you are using a light with a high enough frequency to eject an electron, than atoms can absorb any light above because, the energy in that light, which is ""packed"" into photons, are transferred one for one with electrons. This means that one photon, which has enough energy to ionize an electron by being above the threshold, will impart all of its energy into an electron, raising the electron's PE to 0, ionizing it.Â ",

However, as soon as light has met the minimum threshold frequency, it can be absorbed to eject an electron since the frequency of the light is proportional to the kinetic energy of the electron, thus the more frequency of the light above the minimum threshold frequency, the more energy that the electron gets in order to be ejected.",
4b6af913-ce1d-44a0-9f8a-3fe9e225f017,"The reason only certain frequencies of light are absorbed when trying to excite an electron to a higher energy level is because each electron occupies a different subshell and each subshell has a different response to light. In addition to this, the electron never leaves the atom and has to fall back down to another energy level or subshell, which causes the wavelength of light to be vary specific. Depending on the electron you decide to excite, the wavelength required to excite it will vary. When ejecting an electron, the energy you input can be any value over the minimum threshold frequency because the electron is getting completely removed from the atom. With the ejection of an electron, there is a certain frequency that is required to remove it, which is the threshold frequency. Any value from then on will be able to eject the electron, which is is much more different than the process of exciting an electron.",

The amount of energy between certain shells and subshells is also restricted to certain frequencies because the amount of energy needed to move an electron to a higher energy level is quantized.

However, if light is used to eject an electron from the atom, then this is referring to x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. First, ejecting an electron from the atom refers to ionization energy. As long as the threshold frequency is achieved, then the electron's ionization energy is reached. This means that the remaining energy will be transferred into the electron's kinetic energy due to the conservation of energy. Secondly, all of the values beyond the minimum threshold frequency will simply increase the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.

For example, the n=1 shell can only absorb certain frequencies that allow its electrons in that shell to be excited to the n=2 shell.

However, any value above a minimum threshold frequency can be absorbed because of the quantized nature of light as well. The minimum threshold frequency corresponds to the minimum amount of energy needed to eject an electron. These two findings don't contradict each other because ejecting an electron is an ionization energy that once the electron reaches the E = 0 on the energy diagram it has been ionized. Furthermore, the threshold frequency represents the specific frequency that the atom absorbs in order to be ionized which does show that there are only certain frequencies of light that can be absorbed for ionization of an electron. Moreover, with ionization energy to eject an electron, it doesn't matter what frequency as long as it's above the threshold frequency since any frequency above the threshold frequency will take the electron into free space and out of the atom (above E = 0 dotted line on the energy diagram). However, within an atom, the electronic configurations, such as Oxygen's 1s22s22p4, means that there are two shells (n=1 and n=2) and 3 subshells (1s, 2s, 2p). This means that if electrons can only exist in certain shells or subshells, then it can only absorb a certain frequency to excite it to a higher energy level within the atom as we've learned from photoemission sprectra that only certain energy losses are possible meaning that there are only certain levels of energy available for a particular atom.",

This told us that electrons can't just exist anywhere, but that they have certain energies allows, with each energy change corresponding to a certain color. If we use light to eject an electron, any value above a certain frequency can be observed because now the electron is free from the atom and its possibilities for energy changes within the atom (frequencies) are now infinite.

This is done by absorbing a photon of a particular frequency. Since frequency is proportional with energy, this frequency needs to translate to the correct amount of energy. However, when an electron is ejected from an atom, it can be interpreted as going past the furthest energy level, past where the potential energy is 0. As long as the electron gains enough energy to completely overcome its negative potential energy with the nucleus, it can be ejected, meaning that instead of an exact frequency, anything over a threshold frequency can be used to ionize the atom.Â ",

When energy is added to eject an electron, it has to meet the minimum threshold energy for the electron to be ionized. The threshold frequency value allows only certain frequencies to ionize electrons because the energy added has to be enough to ionize the electrons from certain energy levels within the atom (ex. from the 1s, 2s, 2p, etc).

Photoemission data shows that only certain changes in energy are ever possible when an electron, and therefore, the energy of electrons is quantized.

Though electron energy levels are discrete and quantised, in order to be ejected from the atom, their energy simply needs to be raised to a value above 0. This is because the energy supplied does not only contribute to ionization energy, the transition to Eelectron = 0, as any remaining energy after ionization goes towards the electron's kinetic energy after ejection. Therefore, any energy provided by light which increases the Eelectron to at least 0 (corresponding to the minimum threshold frequency) will successfully eject the atom, though providing different kinetic energies.",

However, if an electron is being ejected from an atom, there is only a minimum threshold frequency to satisfy. Electron's in an atom have negative energy, so to ionize them you must introduce the same or greater than this magnitude of energy.

It is also true that when light is used to eject electrons, any value above the threshold frequency can be absorbed. This is because of conservation of energy: E = IE + KE. As long as the minimum frequency to ionize the electron is met, then the rest of the energy is translated into KE (speed of the electron) so any value above the minimum threshold frequency can be absorbed.

This confinement energy is restricts the amount of energy it can absorb, or else it will go to a different energy level or be ejected.Â  However, if an electron is ejected from an atom with the threshold energy it will useÂ  the specific amount of energy to ionize, then exhibit the excess energy in the form of kinetic energy once it is beyond the confines of orbitals.",
b2560518-4bc9-462c-9641-bf6f390fa262,"b) Electron movement is quantized, and so they can only be excited up to specific energy levels. Each of these possible movements requires a very specific amount of energy, which corresponds to the certain frequencies of light that can be absorbed. If the light is not of the proper frequency, it simply won't be absorbed, and so we know light is always conserved in both cases.

Â 

When ejecting an electron, you are not just moving it to a higher energy level, you are actually removing it from the atom (conceptually a distance of infinity away in Coulomb's Law). The minimum threshold frequency is the minimum amount of energy needed to meet the ionization energy of an electron. Any frequency below this, we will just observe the trend of electrons possibly being excited, but not removed (described above). Once it meets that threshold frequency (ionization energy), any frequency value can be absorbed because the electron has the energy it needs to be ejected, and any excess energy will be converted into the electron's kinetic energy, so once again energy is conserved. So, an electron can absorb any frequency above the threshold because no matter what the frequency is, it will still have enough energy to ionize, and any excess will just convert into how quickly it is ejected.",
263af335-57b9-414f-9f8c-374a2c3dad16,"When we use light to excite an electron in an atom, electrons can only move from a lower energy level to a higher one, and those energy levels are discrete, meaning that there are only certain energy levels available. Thus, the energy transitions between energy levels are also discrete. The energy of the light is absorbed by electron to move from an energy level that is closer to the nucleus to one that is farther, so the energy of the light is equal to the energy difference. Only certain energy differences exist, so only certain energies of light can be absorbed. From photoelectric effect, we know that light is quantized into photons, and light energy is proportional to frequency. So only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed.

The light energy is imparted to the electron to overcome its negative potential energy and the energy left is transferred into the form of kinetic energy of the electron. The minimum threshold (which is used to overcome the potential energy well) shows that there is no constructive interference and thus light is quantized. The fact that any value above the threshold frequency can be absorbed is because the ejected electrons can have any kinetic energy that is the difference between the light energy and potential energy of the electrons. The possible kinetic energies are continuous (not discrete), so the absorbed energies and thus frequencies need not to be discrete.",
8814d73d-8410-4032-8bea-ffa3c3d195cc,"While these two observations both have to do with using light to give energy to an electron, the resultant processes are very different. When light is used to excite an electron to a higher energy level only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed because the energy levels only exist at a certain value. So when the frequency of light does not provide enough energy for the electron to move up to a higher energy level then it will not be absorbed. Likewise if more energy is provided than necessary, the electron will only absorb what is necessary to move into the higher energy level. The electrons cannot exist in energies between the different energy levels so for energy to be conserved, only frequencies of light that can exactly excite an electron to a higher energy level are absorbed. However in ejecting an electron from the atom, as long as the frequency is above a minimum threshold frequency, the atom will absorb the energy. This is a portion of the absorbed energy is used to remove the electron while the rest is converted into kinetic energy for the electron. Therefore energy is conserved. Basically conservation of energy must occur.",
8a50e4a2-9088-4e2c-9211-db6e8c280f2c,"Only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed by electrons in order to jump to a higher energy level because the electrons within atoms are limited to specific energy transitions which are unique to each element. This is demonstrated by the photoemission spectra, since the wavelengths emitted by an excited electron as it goes down to a lower energy shell to be in a relaxed state are specific to the element, which indicates that these energy levels within the atoms are quantized. It is important to note that if an electron is just excited to a higher energy level in the atom, then it is not being ionized to the point where it has a potential energy of zero, instead, the electron is merely excited to a higher energy due to an increase in potential energy. In the photoelectric effect, however, there is a minumum threshold frequency because the electrons have to overcome their negative potential energy in order to be ionized and have a potential energy of zero. Since frequency is proportional to energy, this means that there is a certain frequency that the electron must absorbed to be ionized. This is why once the the threshold frequency has been reached in order to ionize an electron, increasing the frequency beyond that point does not the current, or the number of electrons being ionized. Instead, as frequency increases beyond the threshold frequency for ionization, the kinetic energy of the electrons increases. Therefore, it's not that any value of frequency higher than the threshold can be absorbed by the electrons, instead, the energy that is not used to ionize the electron is then transferred into kinetic energy by the law of conservation of energy.Â ",
e146e645-6548-4032-953c-7a22210d39d0,"In an atom, electrons can only exist in certain energy levels and not in between. As a result, to move to a higher energy level, the frequency of light, which is proportional to the energy of the light, must be of a very specific value. Specifically, the energy of light absorbed must be equal to the difference in energy between the two energy levels the electron is moving between, otherwise the electron cannot transition and cannot absorb that photon. However, when removing an electron, we are completely overcoming the force of attraction between the electron and the nucleus, meaning we need a minimum value to overcome that force of attraction. If we are beyond that value, any addition energy will simply go into increasing the kinetic energy of the ejected electron, as shown by the photoelectric effect.",
a21a02aa-6f94-420a-a5be-e57aab2add9a,"It is true that only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed because it is referring to a change in energy.Â  This is related to an electron moving from a low energy state to a high energy state to absorb light frequency. There are specific shell levels of energy, so it makes sense that only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed. It is also true that any value above the minimum threshold frequency can be absorbed.Â  In this case, rather thanÂ  just transitioning energy levels which only exist in discrete integers, the electron is absorbing energy to be completely removed from an atom. This explains the wave-particle duality of light.Â ",

Since the radiation energy is quantized, we can conclude that it corresponds to a specific energy loss by the atom. Light is used to excite an electron to a higher energy level, as only certain frequencies can be absorbed. From the hydrogen atom, it is shown that different frequencies of light are emitted, thus showing that electrons can only exist in certain energy levels. The minimum frequency corresponds to a minimum energy required to eject an electron. That means by increasing frequency of radiation, there will be an increase the energy of the radiation as needed for electron ejection. Hence, any value above a minimum threshold frequency can be absorbed.",

The reason that atoms only absorb light at specific frequencies is because there are specific energy levels in atoms, and electrons cannot be found in between these energy levels when they are moving from an excited state to a lower energy level. In order to eject an electron, photoelectron spectroscopy is used to add energy through photons (quantized packets of light), which ionizes the electron and causes it to eject with an energy that correlates to the frequency of the photon that was shone on it (shown with the photoelectric effect). This will only occur if the frequency of the photon is above the threshold frequency of the atom.",
db3c068c-8677-4c63-bb93-17b1ec8b768a,"We know that the atomic structure of an atom is such that there are specific electron-shells, fixed distances away from each other, and from the nucleus. An electron can only exist at those fixed distances. Consequently, there are only specific amounts of energy that will cause an electron to move from one energy level to the next, and because we know frequency of light is representative to the amount of energy a photon of light has, only certain frequencies of the light can be absorbed. However, to eject an electron from the atom, the atom will be floating in free space, and can consist of any amount of Kinetic Energy after it has left the atom, free from the constraints of energy shells. That is why, if the photon carries enough energy, i.e. small enough wavelength, the electron will be ejected, and depending on the amount of ""left-over"" energy Photon energy - Ionization energy, will be put in the form of Kinetic energy.",
c4db1d62-875b-4b40-ba21-b6c0c9b11538,"In order for a photon to be able to excite an electron to a higher energy level, it must have the right amount of energy. It cannot have less than that energy or more than that energy since the electron is bound to the atom which it resides in. If a photon has the wrong frequency, it won't be able to move the electron as the amount of energy won't match with the energy needed for the electron to be excited to the next state.Â 

On the other hand, when ejecting an electron, there is only a minimum amount of energy needed and not specific amounts. This means that any amount of energy over the ionization energy needed will be enough to remove an electron. This is because when you remove an electron, it can receive extra energy that is converted into kinetic energy afterwards.Â ",

Because there are only certain specific energy levels that exist in an atom, electrons can only move up or down to these specific energy levels, so a specific frequency of light must be absorbed in order to have just enough energy to move an electron to a higher energy level. However, with ionization energy, which is used to eject an electron, one can use more energy than the ionization energy required because the electrons are not moving up or down energy levels in this process.",
8b0247b4-00f8-4142-a96d-3dd009748eaa,"Any frequency value above the threshold can eject an electronÂ  because any ""excess"" energy in the light absorbed can be converted into the Kinetic energy of the ejected electron, since we know the total energy of the light = the initial IE + the resulting Kinetic Energy. This is not true for an electron being excited to a higher energy level within an atom because there are specific energy values of each energy level, and specific values for energy or frequency are required to move an electron from 1 level to another. Electrons can't be between 2 energy levels, there's no such thing as a ""2.5"" energy level; so to move either fully up an energy level or fully down, a specific frequency is required.",
5b8ece7a-de04-4fce-8162-c2dc07bbcf63,"Only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed when exciting an electron in an atom to a higher energy level, because electrons must reside in the energy levels for the atom's shells, and these shells only have certain energy levels. Thus, the frequency of light absorbed can only be the difference between two of these shells. However, when ejecting an electron from the atom any frequency above a minimum threshold can be absorbed because the excess energy is simply retained by the atom as kinetic energy. The electron absorbs the energy, loses an amount equal to the ionization energy while distancing itself from the atom, and any excess energy remains with the electron as kinetic energy.",
f2f0d935-8c6b-42d8-bb07-327f27c0c4e6,"In order to excite an electron to a higher energy level in an atom, the frequency must relate to the change in energy between two shells (the one the electron was excited from and the one the electron ended up in). If the frequency is above or below this value, it will not excite the electron. In order to eject an electron from the atom, it must absorb an energy greater than its ionization energy. Because the frequency of light is related to energy (proved by the photoelectric effect), as long as the frequency absorbed is high enough, it will absorb a high enough energy to eject the electron. These two statements can be reconciled because they are referring to two different processes: exciting an electron and ionizing an electron.",

Because electrons can only reside in certain orbitals, with certain distinct energy levels, and transition between them when they absorb energy, only specific frequencies can be absorbed.Â 

On the other hand, when light is used to eject an electron, once the energy threshold is passed, any value can be absorbed. This is because the amount of energy absorbed by the atom is only the amount needed to fully remove the electron from the atom (infinite distance), the rest of the energy will be absorbed by the electron in the form of kinetic energy. Since ""left over"" energy will become kinetic energy, any amount energy can now be absorbed.",
8a2e54fb-75a8-4812-a140-484073eac3f3,"In photoemission, light is used to excite an electron to a higher energy level. This then causes the atom to emit a photon as the higher energy electron falls to a lower energy level. This photon has a specific energy correlating with the certain frequencies of light absorbed, and frequency is proportional the energy. Since the energy of the photon emitted corresponds with the energy lost by the atom according to the conservation of energy, this shows that only certain energy losses are possible. Therefore, only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed because specific energy losses indicate only certain energy levels are possible for the electron to be excited and fall to.Â 

In the photoelectric effect, any frequency above the threshold frequency can be absorbed. This is because the threshold frequency is the frequency needed to eject one electron. Any value below the frequency cannot eject an electron. Any frequency above it can be absorbed because the left over energy that is not used to eject an electron is converted into the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.",
6ac1e34f-18ed-495f-8997-daf4cd9a5a4a,"The first statement is true because light is quantized and has wave-particle duality, as demonstrated by the photoelectric effect, which showed that the frequency of light can effect the energy of an electron and force it into a higher energy level past a certain threshold frequency, but increasing the intensity of the light can't (which, if light were purely a wave, we would think by constructive interference it could). Because light is quantized, electrons can't move an occupy any spot around an atom; they can only occupy certain energy levels. What is important is that we are not giving these electrons enough energy to completely leave the atom.

If light is used to eject an electron from the atom, any value above a minimum threshold will work. This is because the total energy of the electron will be equal to the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. Once enough energy has been put into an atom to negate the negative potential energy and release it from the atom, all excess energy will go into the kinetic energy of the electron ejected - i.e. any more energy will just make it eject faster.

This shows how both can be true: when moving within an atom, the quantization of light means that only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed. However, when being ejected from an atom, past that certain threshold frequency all excess energy turns into the kinetic energy it leaves with. This means both can be true.",
c5c80766-42f7-4585-bdf4-e8cec6143afc,"In this scenario, it can be seen that the first statement is talking about the atomic absorption within an atom. Within each atom, certain frequencies are emitted. Furthermore, certain frequencies of light correlate with certain energies of light absorbed/gained.Â We can use the photon nature of light to see that energy is quantized, so therefore it can be seen that when a frequency is emitted, it relates to a specific energy. Therefore, each atom has specific energies which can then be seen as energy levels such as n=1, n=2, etc. Furthermore, this means that if an electron wanted to get excited from n=2 to n=5, there would have to be a certain amount of light that can be used to excite that electron to that specific energy state. However, looking at the second observation, that is looking at the photoelectric effect.Â  In photoelectron spectroscopy, the energy in a photon is both used to ionize the electron or eject it and also impart it with kinetic energy. Therefore, if the minimum threshold frequency is achieved, the electron will eject out of the atom and the rest of the energy will be used as Kinetic Energy outside of the atom as it is ionized and completely removed (as opposed to an electron being excited within the atom).",

However, electrons can be ejected by absorbing any frequency of light above a threshold frequency because whatever energy is ""leftover"" after the ionization energy can be converted to any amount of kinetic energy that the electron leaves the atom with. This argument does not apply to the first statement because the kinetic energy of the electron in an energy level in the atom is defined by the space and cannot be the energy transferred to the electron from light.",

Therefore for an electron to move between two shells/subshells in an atom, it must absorb the specific frequency of light that has the energy corresponding to the difference between the energy it has and the energy of a different shell.Â 

By contrast, if a photon has more energy that the magnitude of the potential energy of an electron in an atom then the electron can absorb it no matter its frequency because, by supplying enough energy to free the electron from an atom, it means that electron is no longer constricted to the distinct energy values present in an atom because it is no longer associated with that atom.",

However, the photoelectric effect removes electrons from the atom, or ionizes them. On the other hand, exciting electrons to a higher level, seen in the photoemission spectroscopy, only sees electrons move up in energy levels, not outside of the atom. Because one remains in the atom while the other removes it from the atom, the quantized frequencies from the first statement doesn't apply to ionization energies of the 2nd as the energy is used to ionize the electron and then transferred to kinetic energy, which isn't quantized.",

So, energy is quantized, meaning to excite an electron to a higher energy level, there are specific energies needed to be absorbed, which is why the first observation is correct. However, the second observation that when ejecting an electron any value above a minimum threshold frequency can be absorbed because, as seen through the photoelectric effect, the energy of a photon is equal to the ionization energy plus the kinetic energy of the ejected electron (conservation of energy).

Â 

Sentence #2: This is because electrons have certain ionization energies, ex. the energy needed to raise its potential energy to zero from within an atom. Any additional energy past that energy difference will be translated into Kinetic energy for the ionized electron, which means that it is still absorbed by the electron, but now exists as kinetic energy. This is not contradictory to the evidence for discrete electronic transition levels within an atom, because the threshold frequency still shows that electrons only exist in certain regions of the atom, because only above that specific frequency will they actually be able to be ionized (differs for each subshell/shell), shows that electron exists in certain levels to have that certain energy difference from its potential energy within the shell up till zero. Anything past is kinetic energy post-ionization (after it has been ejected) which reconciles these two statements.",

If the energy is used to eject an electron any frequency above the threshold frequency can be absorbed because the electron does not have to reach a specific point in space as it would have to do if it were moving electron shells. The excess energy absorbed will contribute to the kinetic energy of the electron that is ejected.",

Energy of light is directly related to its frequency, so likewise, only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed to raise electrons to these higher energy levels.Â 

Â 

Once an electron is removed from an atom, however, it does not have only these specific energy levels it can transition to - it simply leaves the atom, so it does not reside within the energy levels of an atom anymore. Thus, at any frequency above the minimum frequency required to remove the electron from the atom, the electron will still be removed, and the greater the energy absorbed is than the ionization energy, the more kinetic energy the electron will be left with.

The fact that when an electron is removed from an atom, it is not restricted to energy levels anymore is the why both of these observations are true.",

Likewise, the differences between these values (i.e., moving between them) are also discrete. However, to completely eject it means to remove it from the energy levels that are bound to that atom. Therefore, you only need to provide the minimum amount of force, and that electron is free from that atom.",

Electrons can absorb light with any frequency over the threshold frequency because each frequency corresponds to an energy being absorbed by the electron and after enough energy is given to ionize the electron, the rest will go into the kinetic energy of the electron emitted.

However, the quantization of energy levels prevents continuous absorption: excited electrons will move up to higher, quantized energy levels. Excited electrons are not ejected from the atom. When an electron is ejected, its potential energy (from Coulomb's Law) reaches zero, which showcases that the nucleus is no longer attracting the electron, and the electron is ionized. Once the threshold frequency is reached, the electron is ionized. The atom can absorb any value above the minimum threshold frequency because this frequency completely removes the electron from the atom (the electron will not remain constrained to quantized energy levels).

The atom's electron (if it is to remain within the atom because the input energy is below the threshold frequency) can only accept distinct energy amounts that let it travel to allowed energy levels, so only certain energies of light can be absorbed. Since the energy of light is directly proportional to the frequency, this means only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed. However, if an electron is ejected from the atom, any excess energy given to the electron is stored within the electron as kinetic energy.

For the second observation, the energy of a photon is directly proportional to the frequency of light used. Furthermore, to eject an electron from the atom, enough energy must be supplied to it in order to eject from the atom. Here, each photon must have sufficient energy to provide the electron with enough energy to leave the atom. Since the energy of the photon is dependent on the frequency, there must be a minimum threshold for the frequency for it to remove the electron. Anything at that frequency or greater will be absorbed by the atom and will crate enough energy to eject an electron from the atom.

These both can be true as they both represent different things: it is not comparable to move an electron between two energy levels and to eject an electron from the atom completely, as they both involve different relations with the frequency.",

If an electron is not excited with enough energy to reach the next highest subshell, or energy state, it will not be able to produce any light, because electrons cannot exist between these subshells. It will simply return to the lower subshell. Therefore, only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed to excite electrons to higher energy levels. However, when an electron is ejected from an atom, it simply absorbs the energy equal to its ionization energy in order to leave the atom, and then is ejected. Frequency is proportional to energy (E = hv), so one can think of an increase in frequency of the light as an increase in the energy of the light and therefore an increase in the energy absorbed by the electron. Any leftover energy after the electron is ejected is transformed into kinetic energy, so higher frequencies can continue to be absorbed by the atom; they will simply result in a greater electron speed after ejection.",

On the other hand, ejecting an electron just requires an energy above its ionization energy because any extra energy absorbed by the electron goes towards the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.

Once a threshold frequency is reached by the light being absorbed by the atom, the electron is ejected and no longer a part of the atom. For this reason it can absorb any frequency of light above the threshold frequency because it is no longer constrained to exist only in certain energy levels. Light with frequency above the threshold also has energy above the ionization energy.

When an electron moves from a lower to a higher energy state, it must do so in a step-wise manner where there are only specific energy transitions available as there are discrete distances from the nucleus for which the electron can reside in. Thus, when an electron transitions from a less excited to a more excited state, there are only specific energy differences that are available. And since we know energy of an electron is directly proportional to the frequency of light as demonstrated by the photoelectric effect, the discrete energy changes correspond to only certain frequencies of absorbed light.Â 

However, when ejecting an electron from an atom, there first must be enough energy (indicated by a threshold frequency) for the electron to overcome its ionization energy. Any value above the minimum threshold frequency corresponding to more energy is then simply transferred to the electron's kinetic energy due to the conservation of energy. Thus, any value of an electron's kinetic energy can be observed, and since electron kinetic energy is directly proportional to light frequency, then there exists a continuum of frequencies that an atom can absorb for electron ejection.",

This idea that any value above the threshold can be absorbed does not apply to exciting an electron to a higher energy level as the electron being excited will not be ejected from the atom.Â  Â So, the light needed to excite an electron only to a higher energy level will need a specific frequency.",

It is also true that to eject an electron (also known as ionization), any value above a frequency threshold can be absorbed. This is because to ionize an electron you must get it's energy from a negative PE up to 0 so that it will leave the atom into free space. Therefore, no specific amount of energy is needed, just enough to get it to zero. Therefore there is a minimum frequency to create a minimum energy to eject the electron.",

However, any value above a minimum threshold frequency can be absorbed to eject an electron because at that point, the electron is not in the atom anymore (it does not have to have specific energies). Once the electron has a potential energy of 0 or more, it is no longer attracted to the nucleus. Relative potential energy of an electron attracted to the nucleus is ((Zeff)(e-)/radius). Any frequency of light that gives the electron enough energy to be at such a great distance away from the nucleus such that the potential energy is 0 allows the electron to not be attracted to the nucleus. If the electron is no longer part of the atom, it no longer needs to occupy energy levels of specific energies.

Once potential energy is 0, the electron no longer is attracted to the nucleus and is ionized from the atom. The threshold frequency of light is the frequency that has just enough energy to increase the potential energy of the electron to 0. After the electron is ionized, there are no discrete energy levels that the electron must be in since it is not on the atom anymore and unless it comes in contact with a charged mass, the potential energy will remain at zero. As a result, any frequency higher than the threshold frequency would have a greater energy that would just contribute to the kinetic energy of the ionized electron.Â ",

However, when at electron is ejected it leaves the atom completely. All the excess energy of light that isn't used to ionize it becomes the kinetic energy of an electron.

Exciting a ground-state electron requires the input of energy to move the electron further from the nucleus to a higher energy electron shell. This electron is moving from a specific low-energy state to a specific higher-energy state, so the energy that it gains must also be specific. The electron can only exist at certain levels of energy characterized by the electron shells, so the input energy to excite an electron must abide by this specificity. Therefore, electrons can only absorb certain wavelengths of light that contain the exact amount of energy that is allowed within the atom for excitement. When ejecting an electron, the electron's potential energy toward the nucleus must be overcome. As soon as enough energy is put into the electron to surpass the electronic pull it feels to the nucleus, the electron is ejected.

They must achieve a specific energy change, that can only be provided at the absorption of specific frequencies of light.Â However, to eject an electron, the light must only provide a minimum amount of energy for the electron to escape the pull of the nucleus, and exist in free space.

If light has some energy that is not equal to one of the differences in energy of the energy levels, an electron it interacts with will not be excited to a higher energy level. However, in the case of ionization, all the electron needs to do is have enough energy to escape the attractive forces that it has with the nucleus, which means that it does not need a specific amount of energy like when changing energy levels.

Contrary to this, to excite an electron to a specific energy level, only a specific energy light can be used because these energy levels exist in a fixed distance from the nucleus due to the electric charges of the subatomic particles.

However, in order to be ejected (or ionized!),Â  electrons have specific ionization energies that correspond to a minimum threshold frequency that is required to... ionize the electron. The reason it can absorb frequencies above this minimum threshold frequency however is because once the electron is ejected (surpassing the energy required to ionize it), the excess energy will be translated into the kinetic energy of the ejected electron as it is no longer located in a discrete energy level, making it a free electron that can absorb any frequency of light.",

So essentially, because of the law of conservation of energy, increasing the (frequency)energy of the light, would make the ejected electron move faster, and that kinetic energy does not need to be quantized for any reason.

This was shown by the photoelectric effect where no matter how high the intensity, if it was below the threshold frequency, no electrons would be emitted.

This can vary so much, because the electron is now outside of the atom and doesn't fall into a shell. When light is absorbed, the electron is still bound by the atom and can only fall into a specific shell.

Using photoemission spectroscopy, we see that when this excited electron relaxes, going from its a excited state to a lower energy state, the energy lost or emmitted has a frequency corresponding to the energy it absorbed. This reveals that the energy levels where electrons can reside in an atom are quantized and so only specfic frquencies will be absorbed because only specific energy transitions are possible. On the other hand, when electron is ejected, the minimum thrshold frequency has been achieved to ionize the electron, so whatever excess energy the photon tranmsits to the ejected electron is used as kinetic energy because of the law of conservation of energy. Hence, the atom absorbs any frequency above the frequency theshold required to eject the electron, but this surplus energy is transformed to kinetic energy. Below the threshold frequency (photoemission spectroscopy), the atom onloy absorbes the energy required for a eenrgy transimission between the discrete energy locations in which the electrons can reside.",

If light is used to eject an electron, any value above the minimum threshold frequency can be absorbed since the threshold frequency is the minimum value from where electrons are allowed to be ejected.

748fd48d-b70a-42bc-8013-ccf2843170b0,"Only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed due to the fact that energy levels are quantized. Because of this, the emitted frequency corresponds to a specific energy level. An atom emits radiation of a specific frequency, and since this radiation is also quantized, this means that this corresponds to specific energy losses that are permitted by the atom. And because only certain frequencies are emitted, this means that specific energy losses are allowed and only certain energies are available to the atom. The reason any value above a minimum threshold frequency can be absorbed when an electron is ejected is due to the fact that when an electron is ionized, any leftover energy is absorbed as kinetic energy, per the law of conservation of energy (E = IE + KE). Depending on which electron is ionized, the kinetic energy is different.",

Any frequency above the minimum threshold frequency works for ionizing electrons because the electron is not being excited to a specific energy level it is just simply ejected and any excess energy leftover after ionization translates to kinetic energy in the electron.Â ",

24e63ed9-6eb5-4fd8-b526-eb49db10db88,"The reason that if light is used to excite an electron to a higher energy level in an atom that only certain frequencies are accepted is that only certain transitions in energy can occur in the atom. The energy levels in an atom are quantized values, and thus, electrons will experience these same numerical values for changes in energy in an atom whether they are being excited, or whether then are relaxing from an excited position back to their ground state, this is due to the fact that they are moving between specific energy levels. They only can do so in the specific values of energy associated with that energy level, and thus only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed.Â 

That being said, if light is used to eject an electron fromÂ  the atom, any value above a minimum threshold frequency can be absorbed because the energy from the light then becomes kinetic energy for the electron. Firstly, the energy from the light is put into actually ejecting the electron (i.e. ionization energy), but after the electron reaches a potential energy of zero and is ejected from the atom, the surplus energy absorbed from the light is transferred to kinetic energy of the electron, thus explaining why any frequency over the minimum threshold frequency (i.e. the energy required to emit the electron) can be absorbed. Furthermore this is evidenced by the fact that after this threshold frequency, we see kinetic energy increasing with a constant slope as frequency increases when we plot frequency of light versus the resultant kinetic energy of the electron and this is because after the threshold, the additional energy absorbed becomes kinetic energy.Â ",

cd7f0c10-196f-440e-a3db-c3805b38a665,"Ejecting an electron from an atom has to do with the Photoelectric Effect, which had experiments conducted by Einstein. Einstein examined the effects of frequency and brightness on kinetic energy and amouny of electrons or current. As a result of his experiments, Einstein saw that electrons would be ejected only if they are exposed to a frequency above a certain threshold v>v0. This proved that light is acting in a quantized manner, and frequency is directly prop. to energy. As a result, we see that as light is quantized, we have to go above a minimum threshold frequency and any value would be absorbed.

In contrast, when light is used to excite an electron to eject it from the atom, the electron is not moving to a specific state of energy like an orbital.

However, ejecting an electron entails removing the electron entirely from the atom and bringing the potential energy of the electron to 0. In order to do this, the minimum threshold frequency must bring the electron to 0 potential energy, which means that any frequency that is at least as large as the minimum threshold frequency is capable of completely ejecting the electron.",

The first statement, which describes photoabsorption spectroscopy only allows certain frequencies of light to be absorbed because the electrons are not being ionized or removed from the atom but rather transferred to higher energy levels. Because of this, only certain frequencies may be allowed because electrons in an atom are restricted to certain orbitals in its movement. For example, if electrons moved around an atom freely within any space, the photoabsorption spectra for elements would be completely dark, as the frequencies of all light would be able to be absorbed and light would be undetected in the spectrum. However, ejection of an electron is the complete removal of an electron from the atom. In an analogy with a wall and a wrecking ball, any amount of wrecking balls would still bring down a singular wall. It merely needs to take enough force or energy (or, in the case of an electron, frequency) to knock down the wall (to overcome the threshold for the necessary amount of energy to remove an electron).",

Only certain frequencies of light are absorbed when exciting an electron because the frequencies of light that are being absorbed are related to the distinct energy transitions that an atom has. Electrons are only excited within the atom. Only light of the wavelengths that match the amount of energy needed for an electron to transition between shells is absorbed. Electrons exist at specific energies, shells, so the change in energy from one shell to another is fixed. Thus, only certain frequencies of light can be absorbed for an electron to move up a certain number of shells.

When light is used to eject an electron, light must reach a threshold frequency because there only needs to be a certain amount of energy to ionize an electron. Electrons are not moving between specific shells, like in excitation, they are moving up to meet the threshold for ionization, and leaving the atom, which would be the 0 mark or above on an energy diagram. Frequency relates to the energy put into each electron as shown by the photoelectric effect. Once frequency and therefore energy reaches a high enough level, electrons can be ejected. Since electrons only need enough energy to be ionized, the rest of the energy is transferred to kinetic energy according to the conservation of energy.Â
